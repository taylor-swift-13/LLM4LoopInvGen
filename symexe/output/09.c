# Loop Invariant Format Conversion

I notice you've asked me to convert ACSL-format loop invariants into the specified Syntax Tree Format, but you haven't provided any specific ACSL invariants to convert (the input section states "None").

For me to perform the conversion, I would need you to provide the ACSL-format loop invariants that you want converted. The examples you've provided show how the conversion should work:

1. Replacing `\at(var, Pre)` with `var@pre`
2. Using `Inv` instead of `loop invariant`
3. Combining multiple invariants with `&&` operators
4. Preserving all logical structure and semantics

If you provide the ACSL-format loop invariants you want converted, I'll be happy to apply the conversion according to your specified Syntax Tree Format.
