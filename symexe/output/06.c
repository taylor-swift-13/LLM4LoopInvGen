I notice that your latest query asks me to convert ACSL-format loop invariants to a specific syntax tree format, but you haven't provided any input loop invariants to convert. The "Input: None" section indicates there's no code for me to transform.

To help you with this conversion task, I would need you to provide the ACSL-format loop invariants that you want converted to the syntax tree format. Once you provide those, I can apply the requested transformations:

1. Replace \at(var, Pre) with var@pre
2. Use "Inv" instead of "loop invariant"
3. Preserve the logical structure and semantics
4. Format according to your specified syntax tree format

Please provide the ACSL loop invariants you'd like me to convert, and I'll be happy to help with the transformation.
