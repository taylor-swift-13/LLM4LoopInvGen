I notice the task is to convert ACSL-format loop invariants to a specific Syntax Tree Format, but the input section states "ACSL-format loop invariants: None". Without specific loop invariants to convert, I can't perform the requested conversion.

If you'd like me to convert loop invariants from one of your previous messages, please provide them explicitly, and I'll be happy to convert them to the Syntax Tree Format following your guidelines.

For a proper conversion, I would:
1. Replace \at(var, Pre) with var@pre
2. Use "Inv" instead of "loop invariant"
3. Join multiple invariants with "&&"
4. Preserve the logical structure and semantics

Once you provide the specific loop invariants you want converted, I can apply these transformation rules correctly.
