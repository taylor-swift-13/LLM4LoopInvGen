I notice that you've asked me to convert ACSL-format loop invariants to a specific syntax tree format, but you haven't provided the ACSL invariants to convert. The second request shows examples of the conversion process but doesn't include the actual input for me to work with.

Would you like me to:

1. First complete the original task (Step Id: 2) by analyzing the C program and filling in the PLACE_HOLDER invariants, and then convert those to the syntax tree format?

2. Or did you intend to provide specific ACSL invariants for me to convert?

Please clarify which invariants you'd like me to convert to the syntax tree format.
