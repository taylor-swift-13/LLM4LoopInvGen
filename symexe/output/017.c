I notice your most recent query asks me to convert ACSL-format loop invariants to a specific syntax tree format, but you haven't provided any input invariants to convert (you specified "ACSL-format loop invariants: None").

If you'd like me to help with loop invariant analysis, correction, or conversion, I'd be happy to do so, but I'll need you to provide the specific loop invariants you want me to work with.

Based on your previous queries, I can see you're working with Frama-C verification and need help with loop invariants for a C function `foo(int n)` that contains nested loops. If you'd like me to:

1. Analyze and fix the failing loop invariants in that program
2. Generate appropriate loop invariants to verify the post-condition
3. Convert existing ACSL annotations to the syntax tree format

Please let me know which task you'd like me to focus on and provide the necessary input.
