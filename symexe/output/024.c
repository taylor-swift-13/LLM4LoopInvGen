I notice that there are no ACSL-format loop invariants provided to convert. The "Input" section specifies "None". 

To complete the conversion task, I would need the original ACSL-format loop invariants that need to be transformed into the syntax tree format. Would you like me to convert the loop invariants from one of your previous examples? Or do you have specific ACSL-format invariants you'd like me to convert?
