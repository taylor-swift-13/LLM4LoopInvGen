I notice that you haven't provided any ACSL-format loop invariants to convert in the "Input" section. Your task description is clear, but I need actual ACSL code to convert to the specified syntax tree format.

Could you please provide the ACSL loop invariants you'd like me to convert? Once you provide those, I can transform them according to your specifications:

1. Replace \at(var, Pre) with var@pre
2. Use "Inv" instead of "loop invariant" 
3. Preserve all logical structure and semantics

I'll be happy to perform the conversion once you provide the input code.
