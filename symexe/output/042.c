# Loop Invariant Conversion

Thank you for your request to convert ACSL-format loop invariants into the specified Syntax Tree Format. However, I notice that you haven't provided any specific ACSL-format loop invariants to convert in your input section (it says "None").

To help you with this conversion, I would need you to provide the specific ACSL loop invariants that you want converted to the new syntax tree format.

If you'd like to provide these invariants, I'll be happy to:
1. Replace `\at(var, Pre)` with `var@pre`
2. Use `Inv` instead of `loop invariant`
3. Preserve all logical structure and semantics
4. Format according to the syntax tree format you specified

Please provide the ACSL-format loop invariants that you want converted, and I'll help you with the conversion right away.
