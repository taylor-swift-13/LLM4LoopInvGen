### Analysis of the Given C Loop

#### a. Purpose and Structure of the Loop:
The objective of the loop in the function `foo` is to increment the variable `i` from its initial value of 1 up to and including the value of `size`. Simultaneously, it increments the variable `sn` each time `i` is incremented. The loop essentially counts how many iterations it takes for `i` to exceed `size`, which is represented by the value of `sn` at the loop’s termination.

**Structure**:
- **Condition**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than or equal to `size`.
- **Operations**: In each iteration, `i` is incremented by 1 and `sn` is also incremented by 1.
- **Variables**: The relevant variables are:
  - `i`: starts at 1 and counts upwards.
  - `sn`: starts at 0 and counts the number of iterations.

#### b. Discussion of the Loop Invariant:
The proposed loop invariant must express the relationship between `sn`, `i`, and `size` throughout the execution of the loop. A valid invariant could be that:
- `sn` counts how many times `i` has been incremented.
- When the loop starts, `sn` is 0, and `i` is 1.
- Therefore, after `k` iterations, `i` will be `k + 1` and `sn` will be `k`.

Thus, the invariant proposed could be:
- `sn == i - 1`, which indicates that the number of increments to `sn` corresponds to the number of increments to `i` from its starting point.

#### c. Establishment:
Before the loop starts, we have:
- `sn == 0`
- `i == 1`

At this point, `sn` indeed equals `i - 1` since `0 == 1 - 1`. Therefore, the invariant `sn == i - 1` holds true before the loop begins.

#### d. Preservation:
Assuming the invariant `sn == i - 1` holds at the beginning of an iteration and the loop condition `i <= size` is satisfied, we consider the end of the iteration:
- `i` is incremented by 1: `i` becomes `i + 1`.
- `sn` is also incremented by 1: `sn` becomes `sn + 1`.

Now, substituting:
- The invariant before the iteration: `sn == i - 1`.
- After the iteration: `sn + 1 == (i + 1) - 1`, which simplifies to `sn + 1 == i`, confirming that the invariant remains true after the iteration.

#### e. Termination Analysis of the Loop:
The loop terminates when `i` exceeds `size`. At this point:
- The last valid state before termination will be `i = size + 1` and `sn = size`.

Thus, the invariant `sn == i - 1` holds as `size == (size + 1) - 1`.

#### f. Correctness of the Post-condition:
The post-condition asserts that if `sn != size`, then `sn` must be 0. This is consistent because the loop increments `sn` with every valid iteration of `i`, which only occurs while `i <= size`. If `sn` equals `size`, it indicates that the loop has executed exactly `size` times, making `sn` equal to `size`, and thus the assertion holds true.

#### g. Implication of the Pre-condition:
The pre-condition specifies that `sn` is initialized to 0 and `i` starts at 1, which directly satisfies the invariant `sn == i - 1`. Thus, the pre-condition guarantees that the invariant is established before the loop begins its execution.
