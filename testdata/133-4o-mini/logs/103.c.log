### Analysis of the C Loop

#### a. Purpose and Structure of the Loop:
The objective of the loop is to increment the variable `x` from its initial value of 0 to 100. The loop continues executing as long as `x` is less than 100. During each iteration, `x` is incremented by 1. The relevant variable is `x`, which is initialized to 0 before the loop starts.

#### b. Discussion of the Loop Invariant:
The proposed loop invariant is `((x == 0)) || (0 <= x <= 100)`. This invariant states that either `x` is equal to 0 or `x` is within the bounds of 0 and 100, inclusive. It is considered a valid invariant because:
- At the beginning of the loop, since `x` is initialized to 0, the invariant holds true.
- During each iteration, since `x` is incremented by 1, it will always remain between 0 and 100 until the loop condition fails.

#### c. Establishment:
Before the loop begins execution, `x` is initialized to 0. Thus, the invariant `((x == 0)) || (0 <= x <= 100)` is satisfied since the first part of the disjunction (`x == 0`) holds true.

#### d. Preservation:
If the invariant holds at the start of an iteration (i.e., `((x == 0)) || (0 <= x <= 100)`) and the loop condition (`x < 100`) is true, then at the end of the iteration, after executing `x = (x + 1)`, `x` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, if `x` was less than 100 before the increment, it will still satisfy `0 <= x <= 100` after the increment, thus preserving the invariant.

#### e. Termination Analysis of the Loop:
The loop terminates when `x` reaches 100, meaning the loop condition (`x < 100`) becomes false. At this point, `x` is equal to 100. The invariant `((x == 0)) || (0 <= x <= 100)` still holds true because the second part of the disjunction (`0 <= x <= 100`) is satisfied (as `x` equals 100).

#### f. Correctness of the Post-condition:
The post-condition asserts that `x` is equal to 100 after the loop has executed. Since the loop invariant guarantees that `x` remains within the bounds of 0 and 100, and the loop terminates when `x` is exactly 100, the post-condition is indeed satisfied.

#### g. Implication of the Pre-condition:
The pre-condition states that `x == 0` prior to the execution of the loop. This directly establishes the invariant `((x == 0)) || (0 <= x <= 100)` before the loop begins executing, ensuring that the invariant is valid at the start.

### Complete C Loop Program with Invariant Annotations

```c
void foo() {
    int x = 0;
    
    /* >>> LOOP INVARIANT TO FILL <<< 
       >>> PRECONDITION OF THE LOOP : x == 0 <<< */
    
    /*@
      loop invariant  ((x == 0)) || (0 <= x <= 100) ;
    */
    while (x < 100) {
        x  = (x + 1);
    }
    
    /*@ assert x == 100 ; */
}
```

In this completed C program, the `PLACE_HOLDER_x` is filled with the appropriate logical expression concerning the variable `x`, which allows for the verification of the loop's behavior and its post-condition using Frama-C.

void foo() {
    int x = 0;
    
    /*@
      loop invariant  ((x == 0)) || (0 <= x <= 100) ;
    */
    while (x < 100) {
        x  = (x + 1);
    }
    
    /*@ assert x == 100 ; */
}


void foo() {
    int x = 0;
    
    /*@
      loop invariant  ((x == 0)) || (0 <= x <= 100) ;
    */
    while (x < 100) {
        x  = (x + 1);
    }
    
    /*@ assert x == 100 ; */
}
