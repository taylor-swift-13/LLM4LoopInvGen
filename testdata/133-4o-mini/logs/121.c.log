### Analysis of the C Loop Program

#### a. Purpose and Structure of the Loop:
The purpose of the loop is to increment the variable `i` from its initial value of `1` up to `8`, while simultaneously incrementing the variable `sn` starting from `0`. The intended outcome of the loop is that `sn` will equal `8` when `i` exceeds `8`.

The structure of the loop consists of:
- **Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than or equal to `8`.
- **Operations in the Loop Body**: Within each iteration, `i` is incremented by `1` and `sn` is also incremented by `1`.
- **Relevant Variables**: The variables `i` and `sn` are crucial to the behavior of the loop, where `i` serves as the loop counter and `sn` serves as a secondary counter that tracks how many iterations have occurred.

#### b. Discussion of the Loop Invariant:
The proposed loop invariant is:
- `((sn == 0)&&(i == 1)) || (PLACE_HOLDER_i)`
- `((sn == 0)&&(i == 1)) || (PLACE_HOLDER_sn)`

The invariant must hold true for every iteration of the loop. Specifically, it captures the initial conditions (the pre-condition) and asserts that through the loop execution, the relationship between `sn` and `i` remains consistent.

#### c. Establishment:
Before the loop starts execution, the pre-condition `(sn == 0) * (i == 1)` is satisfied. Therefore, at the start of the loop, both invariants are satisfied:
- `((sn == 0)&&(i == 1))` is true.

Thus, the invariant is established as true before the loop execution begins.

#### d. Preservation:
During each iteration of the loop, the following occurs:
- If `i <= 8` (the loop condition holds), then `i` is incremented by `1` and `sn` is also incremented by `1`.
- After the increment, `i` becomes `i + 1` and `sn` becomes `sn + 1`.

Assuming the invariant holds at the start of the iteration, it maintains its truth as both `i` and `sn` are incremented together, preserving the relationship defined in the invariant.

#### e. Termination Analysis of the Loop:
The loop terminates when `i > 8`. At that point, we can assess:
- After the last successful iteration, `i` will be `9` (from `8 + 1`).
- Correspondingly, `sn` will have been incremented `8` times, resulting in `sn == 8`.

Thus, the invariant continues to hold true upon termination since:
- The last valid condition of the loop was `i == 8` and `sn == 8`.
- When `i` becomes `9`, the loop condition is false, and the invariant holds.

#### f. Correctness of the Post-condition:
The post-condition states that if `sn != 0`, then `sn == 8`. At termination, we know that `sn` equals `8`, which satisfies the post-condition whenever it is invoked. The loop invariant ensures that as long as the loop is running, the relationship between `sn` and `i` is preserved.

#### g. Implication of the Pre-condition:
The pre-condition `(sn == 0) * (i == 1)` guarantees that before the loop starts, the invariant is established because it directly aligns with the initial values of `sn` and `i`. Thus, the pre-condition implies that the invariant holds true at the start.

### C Loop Program with Annotations
Now, here is the C loop program with the placeholders filled in:

```c
void foo() {
 
    int i = 1;
    int sn = 0;
    
    /*@
      loop invariant  ((sn == 0)&&(i == 1)) || (sn == i - 1) ;
      loop invariant  ((sn == 0)&&(i == 1)) || (0 <= sn && sn <= 8) ;
    */
    while (i <= 8) {
  
        i  = (i + 1);
        sn  = (sn + 1);
      
    }
            
    /*@ assert (sn != 0) ==> (sn == 8);*/
  
}
```

In this filled-in code, the loop invariant captures the relationship between `sn` and `i` throughout the loop, ensuring that it can be verified by Frama-C.

void foo() {
 
    int i = 1;
    int sn = 0;
    
    /*@
      loop invariant  ((sn == 0)&&(i == 1)) || (sn == i - 1) ;
      loop invariant  ((sn == 0)&&(i == 1)) || (0 <= sn && sn <= 8) ;
    */
    while (i <= 8) {
  
        i  = (i + 1);
        sn  = (sn + 1);
      
    }
            
    /*@ assert (sn != 0) ==> (sn == 8);*/
  
}


void foo() {
 
    int i = 1;
    int sn = 0;
    
    /*@
      loop invariant  ((sn == 0)&&(i == 1)) || (sn == i - 1) ;
      loop invariant  ((sn == 0)&&(i == 1)) || (0 <= sn && sn <= 8) ;
    */
    while (i <= 8) {
  
        i  = (i + 1);
        sn  = (sn + 1);
      
    }
            
    /*@ assert (sn != 0) ==> (sn == 8);*/
  
}
