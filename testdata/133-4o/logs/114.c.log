Let's analyze and generate the necessary loop invariants step by step.

1. **Purpose and Structure of the Loop:**
   - **Objective:** The loop increments the values of `x` and `sn` by 1 in each iteration. The loop runs an unspecified number of times, determined by the return value of the `unknown()` function.
   - **Structure:** 
      - **Condition:** The loop executes as long as `unknown()` returns a non-zero value.
      - **Operations:** Inside the loop, `x` and `sn` are both incremented by 1 in each iteration.
      - **Relevant Variables:** `x` and `sn`.

2. **Discussion of the Loop Invariant:**
   - **Proposed Loop Invariant:** The goal is to maintain the relationship between `x` and `sn` through each iteration. Based on the operations performed within the loop, the invariant should capture the fact that `sn` and `x` are incremented together and thus remain equal.
   - **Validity:** The invariant holds because both `x` and `sn` are incremented equally in each iteration.

3. **Establishment:**
   - Before the loop begins, the pre-condition `(x == 0) && (sn == 0)` holds true. This satisfies the invariant because it implies that `x` and `sn` are initially equal.

4. **Preservation:**
   - In each iteration, `x` and `sn` are both incremented by 1. Therefore, if the invariant holds at the start of the iteration, it will continue to hold at the end of the iteration because the increments preserve the equality.

5. **Termination Analysis of the Loop:**
   - When the loop terminates, the condition `unknown()` becomes false. At this point, the invariant still holds, ensuring that `x` and `sn` are equal, regardless of the number of iterations.

6. **Correctness of the Post-condition:**
   - The post-condition `(sn != x) ==> (sn == -1)` is trivially satisfied because the invariant guarantees that `x` and `sn` are equal. Therefore, `sn != x` is false, making the implication true regardless of the value of `sn`.

7. **Implication of the Pre-condition:**
   - The pre-condition `(x == 0) && (sn == 0)` directly implies the loop invariant because it sets both `x` and `sn` to zero, establishing their equality before the loop begins.

With these analyses, we can now fill in the placeholders for the loop invariants.

```c
int unknown();
void foo() {

    int sn = 0;
    int x = 0;
    
    /* >>> LOOP INVARIANT TO FILL <<< 
       >>> PRECONDITION OF THE LOOP : (x == 0) && (sn == 0) <<< */
    
    /*@
      loop invariant  ((x == 0)&&(sn == 0)) || (sn == x) ;
      loop invariant  ((x == 0)&&(sn == 0)) || (x == sn) ;
    */
    while (unknown()) {
  
      x  = (x + 1);
      sn  = (sn + 1);
      
    }
            
    /*@ assert (sn != x) ==> (sn == -1);*/
  
}
```

    int sn = 0;

      loop invariant  ((x == 0)&&(sn == 0)) || (sn == x) ;
      loop invariant  ((x == 0)&&(sn == 0)) || (x == sn) ;

    while (unknown()) {
  
      x  = (x + 1);
      sn  = (sn + 1);
