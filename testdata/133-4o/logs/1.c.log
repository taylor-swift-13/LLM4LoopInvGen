To analyze the loop and generate the necessary loop invariants, let's break down the requirements step by step:

### a. Purpose and Structure of the Loop

**Objective:**  
The loop increments the variable `y` starting from 0 until it reaches 100,000. Simultaneously, `x` is updated by adding the current value of `y` to it. The objective seems to be to derive a relationship between `x` and `y` that will be true after the loop exits.

**Structure:**  
- **Loop Condition:** The loop continues as long as `y < 100000`.
- **Operations Within the Loop Body:**
  - `x = x + y;`
  - `y = y + 1;`
- **Relevant Variables:** `x` and `y`.

### b. Discussion of the Loop Invariant

The loop invariant must hold at the beginning of each iteration and relate `x` and `y` in a way that supports the loop's purpose and helps to prove the post-condition `x >= y`.

### c. Establishment

Before the loop starts:
- `x == 1`
- `y == 0`

These initial conditions trivially satisfy any loop invariant since they are the same as the pre-condition.

### d. Preservation

If the invariant holds at the start of an iteration and the loop condition holds, the invariant must still hold after `x` and `y` are updated. The invariant should capture the relationship that is maintained by the loop operations.

### e. Termination Analysis of the Loop

When the loop terminates, we have `y == 100000`. At this point, the invariant and the negation of the loop condition should imply the post-condition `x >= y`.

### f. Correctness of the Post-condition

The post-condition `x >= y` will be satisfied if the loop invariant ensures that `x` accumulates enough value relative to `y`.

### g. Implication of the Pre-condition

The pre-condition `(y == 0) * (x == 1)` trivially implies the invariant since it must hold at the start of the loop.

### Loop Invariants

Based on the analysis, we need loop invariants that maintain the relationship of `x` and `y` such that `x` will always be greater than or equal to `y` during the loop execution. 

A simple invariant can be derived based on the operations:
- `x` is incremented by `y` in each iteration, and `y` is incremented by 1.
- At the start, `x = 1`, and `y = 0`.
- After `k` iterations, `x = 1 + 0 + 1 + 2 + ... + (k-1)`, and `y = k`.

Therefore, the sum of the first `k-1` integers is `(k-1)*k/2`, thus:
- `x = 1 + (k-1)*k/2`

We can formulate the invariants as:
- `x >= y`
- `x = 1 + (y-1)*y/2`

        x = x + y;
