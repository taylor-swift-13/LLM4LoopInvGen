To analyze the given loop and determine suitable invariants, let's break down each part of the task:

### a. Purpose and Structure of the Loop:
- **Objective:** The loop's primary purpose seems to increment the values of `x` and `sn` simultaneously by 1 in each iteration.
- **Structure:**
  - **Loop Condition:** `unknown()`, a placeholder for an unspecified condition, meaning the loop could execute any non-negative number of times.
  - **Operations:** In each iteration, both `x` and `sn` are incremented by 1.
  - **Relevant Variables:** The variables `x` and `sn` are crucial since they are both modified in the loop body.

### b. Discussion of the Loop Invariant:
- The proposed loop invariants need to ensure the relationship between `x` and `sn` holds throughout the loop's execution. Given the pre-condition `(x == 0) * (sn == 0)`, it can be inferred that `x` and `sn` have the same value at all times, which is established and maintained by the loop.

### c. Establishment:
- Before the loop starts, the pre-condition `(x == 0) * (sn == 0)` ensures that both `x` and `sn` are initialized to 0, which satisfies both invariants since `x == sn` is true.

### d. Preservation:
- If the invariants hold at the start of a loop iteration, the loop body increments both `x` and `sn` by 1. This preserves the equality `x == sn` because both are incremented equally.

### e. Termination Analysis of the Loop:
- Upon termination, the loop condition `unknown()` becomes false. The values of `x` and `sn` remain equal because they have been incremented equally.

### f. Correctness of the Post-condition:
- The post-condition `(sn != -1) ==> (sn == x)` is satisfied because the invariant `x == sn` ensures that when `sn` is not -1 (which it never is, since it starts at 0 and only increments), `sn` will always equal `x`.

### g. Implication of the Pre-condition:
- The pre-condition `(x == 0) * (sn == 0)` straightforwardly implies the loop invariant `x == sn` at the start since both are initialized to 0.

Now, let's provide the complete C loop program with the placeholders filled in:

```c
int unknown();
void foo() {
    int sn = 0;
    int x = 0;
    
    /* >>> LOOP INVARIANT TO FILL <<< 
       >>> PRECONDITION OF THE LOOP : (x == 0) * (sn == 0) <<< */
    
    /*@
      loop invariant ((x == 0)&&(sn == 0)) || (sn == x);
      loop invariant ((x == 0)&&(sn == 0)) || (x == sn);
    */
    while (unknown()) {
        x = (x + 1);
        sn = (sn + 1);
    }
    
    /*@ assert (sn != -1) ==> (sn == x);*/
}
```

int unknown();
void foo() {
    int sn = 0;
    int x = 0;
    
    /*@
      loop invariant ((x == 0)&&(sn == 0)) || (sn == x);
      loop invariant ((x == 0)&&(sn == 0)) || (x == sn);
    */
    while (unknown()) {
        x = (x + 1);
        sn = (sn + 1);
    }
    
    /*@ assert (sn != -1) ==> (sn == x);*/
}


int unknown();
void foo() {
    int sn = 0;
    int x = 0;
    
    /*@
      loop invariant ((x == 0)&&(sn == 0)) || (sn == x);
      loop invariant ((x == 0)&&(sn == 0)) || (x == sn);
    */
    while (unknown()) {
        x = (x + 1);
        sn = (sn + 1);
    }
    
    /*@ assert (sn != -1) ==> (sn == x);*/
