To analyze the given C program and fill in the loop invariants, let's first understand the purpose and behavior of the loop, and then fill in the placeholders with appropriate expressions.

### Analysis

#### a. Purpose and Structure of the Loop

- **Objective**: The loop increments the variable `i` starting from 1 and `sn` starting from 0, until `i` exceeds 8. The intended outcome is to increment both `i` and `sn` such that `sn` counts the number of iterations, which should be 8 when the loop terminates.
  
- **Structure**:
  - **Loop Condition**: `i <= 8`
  - **Body Operations**: 
    - `i = i + 1;`
    - `sn = sn + 1;`
  - **Relevant Variables**: `i` and `sn`.

#### b. Discussion of the Loop Invariant

The proposed loop invariant should maintain the relationship between `i` and `sn` throughout the loop execution. Since `sn` counts the number of iterations starting from 0, when `i` starts from 1, `sn` should be `i - 1`.

#### c. Establishment

Before the loop starts, `i` is initialized to 1 and `sn` to 0, which satisfies the invariant `sn == i - 1`.

#### d. Preservation

Assuming the invariant `sn == i - 1` holds at the start of an iteration:
- After executing the loop body (`i = i + 1; sn = sn + 1;`), `i` becomes `i + 1` and `sn` becomes `sn + 1`.
- Thus, the invariant `sn == i - 1` is preserved.

#### e. Termination Analysis of the Loop

The loop terminates when `i` becomes 9, making the condition `i <= 8` false for the first time. At this point, `sn` should be 8, ensuring the invariant `sn == i - 1` holds true.

#### f. Correctness of the Post-condition

The post-condition `(sn != 8) ==> (sn == 0)` is trivially true:
- If `sn != 8`, it means the loop did not execute (since `i` started from 1) and `sn` is still 0.
- This is consistent with the pre-condition and the invariant.

#### g. Implication of the Pre-condition

The pre-condition `(sn == 0) * (i == 1)` directly implies the initial state of the loop invariant `sn == i - 1` because `0 == 1 - 1`.

### Filled Program

```c
void foo() {
 
    int i = 1;
    int sn = 0;
    
    /* >>> LOOP INVARIANT TO FILL <<< 
       >>> PRECONDITION OF THE LOOP : (sn == 0) * (i == 1) <<< */
    
    /*@
      loop invariant  ((sn == 0)&&(i == 1)) || (sn == i - 1) ;
      loop invariant  ((sn == 0)&&(i == 1)) || (sn == i - 1) ;
    */
    while (i <= 8) {
  
      i  = (i + 1);
      sn  = (sn + 1);
      
    }
            
    /*@ assert (sn != 8) ==> (sn == 0);*/
  
}
```

This program now has the necessary loop invariants in ACSL annotations filled in, ensuring Frama-C can verify the post-condition.

void foo() {
 
    int i = 1;
    int sn = 0;
    
    /*@
      loop invariant  ((sn == 0)&&(i == 1)) || (sn == i - 1) ;
      loop invariant  ((sn == 0)&&(i == 1)) || (sn == i - 1) ;
    */
    while (i <= 8) {
  
      i  = (i + 1);
      sn  = (sn + 1);
      
    }
            
    /*@ assert (sn != 8) ==> (sn == 0);*/
  
}


void foo() {
 
    int i = 1;
    int sn = 0;
    
    /*@
      loop invariant  ((sn == 0)&&(i == 1)) || (sn == i - 1) ;
      loop invariant  ((sn == 0)&&(i == 1)) || (sn == i - 1) ;
    */
    while (i <= 8) {
  
      i  = (i + 1);
      sn  = (sn + 1);
      
    }
            
    /*@ assert (sn != 8) ==> (sn == 0);*/
  
}

### Error Analysis:

The error message indicates that the loop invariant is not strong enough to prove the post-condition `(sn != 8) ==> (sn == 0)`. The given invariant `((sn == 0)&&(i == 1)) || (sn == i - 1)` accurately describes the relationship between `sn` and `i` during the loop, but it does not provide information about the state of the variables when the loop completes.

To ensure that the assertion holds, we need to express that when `sn != 8`, the loop did not complete the full 8 iterations, implying that `sn` must still be `0`. The existing invariant does not cover this case because it only describes the ongoing relationship during the loop, not the specific condition of completion.

### Fixed C Code:

```c
void foo() {
 
    int i = 1;
    int sn = 0;
    
    /*@
      loop invariant  ((sn == 0)&&(i == 1)) || (sn == i - 1) ;
      loop invariant  ((sn == 0)&&(i == 1)) || (sn == i - 1) ;
      loop invariant i <= 9;
    */
    while (i <= 8) {
  
      i  = (i + 1);
      sn  = (sn + 1);
      
    }
            
    /*@ assert (sn != 8) ==> (sn == 0);*/
  
}
```

By adding the loop invariant `i <= 9`, we ensure that when the loop ends, `i` must be at least `9`, which allows us to correctly reason about the assertion `(sn != 8) ==> (sn == 0)`. If `sn` is not `8`, it must be `0` since the loop did not complete all iterations. This strengthened invariant helps Frama-C verify the post-condition.
