Here's the analysis of the C loop program along with the filled-in ACSL annotations for the loop invariants.

### Analysis

a. **Purpose and Structure of the Loop:**
The objective of the loop is to increment the variable `i` from its initial value of 1 up to 8, while simultaneously incrementing `sn` for each iteration. The loop continues to execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to 8. The intended outcome is to ensure that `sn` counts the number of iterations performed, which should result in `sn` being equal to 7 when `i` equals 8.

b. **Discussion of the Loop Invariant:**
The proposed loop invariant indicates that either the initial conditions hold (i.e., `sn == 0` and `i == 1`), or it describes the relationship between `sn` and `i`. The invariant must ensure that `sn` is always one less than `i` throughout the loop execution.

c. **Establishment:**
Before the loop starts, the pre-condition specifies that `sn == 0` and `i == 1`. This satisfies the loop invariant because both conditions explicitly hold true at the beginning.

d. **Preservation:**
During each iteration, `i` is incremented by 1, and so is `sn`. If we assume the invariant holds at the start of the iteration (i.e., `sn == i - 1`), then after executing the statements `i = (i + 1)` and `sn = (sn + 1)`, it will hold that `sn == i - 1` still holds true, preserving the invariant.

e. **Termination Analysis of the Loop:**
The loop terminates when `i` becomes 9. At this point, `sn` will have been incremented to 8. The loop invariant holds true because when the loop condition is false (`i > 8`), it enforces that `sn == 8` when `i == 9`.

f. **Correctness of the Post-condition:**
When the loop finishes, `sn` will equal 8, which satisfies the post-condition `assert (sn != 8) ==> (sn == 0)`. Since `sn` is 8, the implication holds vacuously true.

g. **Implication of the Pre-condition:**
The pre-condition establishes that `sn == 0` and `i == 1`, which directly satisfies the initial conditions of the loop invariant. There is no conflict between the pre-condition and the invariant, ensuring that the invariant is established before the loop begins execution.
