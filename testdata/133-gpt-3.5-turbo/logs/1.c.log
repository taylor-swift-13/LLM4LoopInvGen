a. Purpose and Structure of the Loop:
The purpose of the loop is to increment the variable `y` from its initial value of `0` to `100000`, while simultaneously updating the variable `x` by adding the current value of `y` to it. The loop continues executing as long as `y` is less than `100000`. The structure consists of a loop condition (`y < 100000`), an increment operation for `y` (`y = y + 1`), and an update operation for `x` (`x = x + y`).

b. Discussion of the Loop Invariant:
The proposed loop invariant is that the conditions regarding `x` and `y` must hold true during each iteration of the loop. The invariant reflects the relationship between `x` and `y` as they are modified within the loop. Specifically, the invariant ensures that the properties of `x` and `y` maintain consistency throughout the loop iterations.

c. Establishment:
Before the loop begins execution, the pre-condition states that `(y == 0) * (x == 1)`. At this point, `x` is assigned `1` and `y` is initialized to `0`. Therefore, the invariant `((y == 0) && (x == 1))` is satisfied.

d. Preservation:
During an iteration, if the invariant holds true, then `y` is incremented by `1`, and `x` is updated to `x + y`. At the beginning of the iteration, let‚Äôs assume `y` is `k`. After the update, `y` becomes `k + 1`, and `x` becomes `x + k`. Thus, the invariant can be shown to hold true at the end of the iteration, as the relationship between `x` and `y` is preserved through the operations performed.

e. Termination Analysis of the Loop:
The loop terminates when `y` reaches `100000`. At this point, the value of `y` is `100000`, and `x` has been updated a total of `100000` times. Since `y` is no longer less than `100000`, the loop condition fails. The invariant remains valid upon termination as we can verify that `x` will be greater than or equal to the final value of `y`, which would be `100000`.

f. Correctness of the Post-condition:
Once the loop has finished executing, `y` equals `100000` and `x` has accumulated the sum of all previous values of `y`, starting from `0` to `99999`. Therefore, `x` will be greater than or equal to `y` at the end of the loop, which satisfies the post-condition of `assert x >= y;`.

g. Implication of the Pre-condition:
The pre-condition guarantees that before the loop begins, `y` is `0` and `x` is `1`. These initial values directly imply the loop invariant `((y == 0) && (x == 1))` is established before the loop execution.

    */
    while (y < 100000) {
        x  = x + y;
        y  = y + 1;

    /*@ assert x >= y; */
