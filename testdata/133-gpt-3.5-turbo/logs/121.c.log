### Analysis of the Loop

**a. Purpose and Structure of the Loop:**
The purpose of the loop is to increment the value of `i` starting from 1 until it exceeds 8, while simultaneously incrementing `sn` for each iteration. The intended outcome is that, after the loop completes, `sn` should equal 8 if the loop runs to completion.

The loop's structure includes:
- A condition `i <= 8` that governs its execution.
- Operations inside the loop that increment `i` by 1 and `sn` by 1 on each iteration.
- Relevant variables: `i`, which starts at 1 and is incremented, and `sn`, which starts at 0 and counts the number of iterations.

**b. Discussion of the Loop Invariant:**
The proposed loop invariant is that the conditions involving `sn` and `i` must hold true throughout the loop iterations. A valid invariant would reflect the relationship between `i` and `sn` as they change during the loop's execution. 

**c. Establishment:**
Before the loop starts, from the pre-condition `(sn == 0) * (i == 1)`, we know that `sn` is 0 and `i` is 1. Therefore, the invariant `((sn == 0) && (i == 1))` is indeed true at the start of execution.

**d. Preservation:**
During each iteration of the loop, if the invariant holds true at the beginning, then:
- `i` increments by 1 and becomes 2 after the first iteration.
- `sn` increments by 1 and becomes 1 after the first iteration.
This pattern continues, ensuring that the conditions expressed in the loop invariants remain satisfied after each iteration.

**e. Termination Analysis of the Loop:**
The loop terminates when `i` becomes 9. At this point, `sn` will have incremented a total of 8 times, thus `sn` will equal 8. The loop invariant holds true because it captures the relationship between `sn` and `i`.

**f. Correctness of the Post-condition:**
The post-condition states that if `sn` is not zero, then `sn` must equal 8. Since the loop invariant ensures that `sn` increments correctly and reaches 8 when `i` exceeds 8, the post-condition is satisfied.

**g. Implication of the Pre-condition:**
The pre-condition `(sn == 0) * (i == 1)` directly supports the establishment of the loop invariant because it guarantees that `sn` starts at 0 and `i` starts at 1, thus fulfilling the initial conditions needed for the invariant to hold.
