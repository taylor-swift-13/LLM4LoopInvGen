### Analysis

#### a. Purpose and Structure of the Loop
The loop's objective is to compute `y = 100 - x` for each value of `x` from 1 to 100 (inclusive). The loop starts with `x = 1` and increments `x` by 1 in each iteration until `x` reaches 101 (at which point the loop condition `x <= 100` becomes false). The relevant variables are `x` (the loop counter) and `y` (the computed value based on `x`).

#### b. Discussion of the Loop Invariant
The loop invariant must capture the relationship between `x` and `y` during the loop's execution. The proposed invariant is:
- `y == 100 - (x - 1)`: This holds because at the start of each iteration, `y` is set to `100 - x` (from the previous iteration), and `x` is then incremented by 1. Thus, at the start of the next iteration, `y` reflects the value of `100 - (x - 1)`.
- `1 <= x <= 101`: This bounds the loop counter `x` between its initial value (1) and its final value (101).

#### c. Establishment
Before the loop starts, `x = 1` and `y` is equal to its initial value (from the pre-condition). The invariant `y == 100 - (x - 1)` simplifies to `y == 100 - 0 = 100`, which is not necessarily true (since `y` could be any initial value). However, the first part of the invariant `(x == 1 && y == \at(y, Pre))` is true before the loop starts, so the disjunctive invariant holds.

#### d. Preservation
Assume the invariant holds at the start of an iteration where `x <= 100`:
1. `y == 100 - (x - 1)` (from the invariant).
2. The loop body sets `y = 100 - x`.
3. Then `x` is incremented to `x + 1`.
At the end of the iteration:
- The new `y` is `100 - x` (from step 2), and the new `x` is `x + 1` (from step 3). Thus, `y == 100 - ((x + 1) - 1) == 100 - x`, which matches the value of `y` set in step 2. The invariant is preserved.
- The bounds on `x` are also preserved: if `x` was between 1 and 100 at the start, then after incrementing, it is between 2 and 101, but the loop condition ensures `x <= 100`, so `x` is at most 100 at the start of the next iteration.

#### e. Termination Analysis
The loop terminates when `x > 100` (i.e., `x == 101`). At termination:
- The invariant `y == 100 - (x - 1)` becomes `y == 100 - (101 - 1) == 0`.
- The bounds on `x` are `x == 101`.
The post-condition `y >= 0` holds because `y == 0`.

#### f. Correctness of the Post-condition
At termination:
- The invariant `y == 100 - (x - 1)` and `x == 101` imply `y == 0`.
- Thus, `y >= 0` is satisfied.

#### g. Implication of the Pre-condition
The pre-condition `x == 1 && y == \at(y, Pre)` implies the first part of the disjunctive invariant `(x == 1 && y == \at(y, Pre))`, so the invariant holds before the loop starts.
