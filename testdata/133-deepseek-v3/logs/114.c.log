### Analysis

#### a. Purpose and Structure of the Loop
- **Objective**: The loop increments both `x` and `sn` by 1 in each iteration. The loop continues for an unknown number of iterations (since the condition is `unknown()`). The post-condition suggests that if `sn` is not equal to `x` at the end, then `sn` must be `-1`. However, given the loop body, `sn` and `x` are always incremented together, so they should always be equal unless the loop never runs (in which case `sn == x == 0`). The post-condition seems to account for some other case not directly reflected in the loop body, but we will focus on the loop invariants.

- **Structure**: 
  - Loop condition: `unknown()` (loop runs an unknown number of times).
  - Loop body: `x = x + 1; sn = sn + 1;`.
  - Relevant variables: `x`, `sn`.

#### b. Discussion of the Loop Invariant
The proposed loop invariant is:
```
((x == 0) && (sn == 0)) || (PLACE_HOLDER_sn);
((x == 0) && (sn == 0)) || (PLACE_HOLDER_x);
```
This suggests that either:
1. The loop has not run (so `x == 0` and `sn == 0`), or
2. The loop has run at least once, in which case some other condition holds for `sn` and `x`.

Given the loop body, the natural condition is that `sn == x` (since both are incremented by 1 in each iteration). Thus, the invariants should be:
```
((x == 0) && (sn == 0)) || (sn == x);
((x == 0) && (sn == 0)) || (x == sn);
```
These are equivalent, so we can simplify to one invariant.

#### c. Establishment
Before the loop starts, `x == 0` and `sn == 0` (from the pre-condition). Thus, the first part of the invariant `(x == 0) && (sn == 0)` is true, so the entire invariant holds.

#### d. Preservation
Assume the invariant holds at the start of an iteration and the loop condition is true (i.e., the loop runs). There are two cases:
1. If the loop has not run yet (`x == 0 && sn == 0`), then after one iteration, `x = 1` and `sn = 1`, so `sn == x` holds.
2. If the loop has run before (`sn == x`), then after incrementing both, `sn` and `x` are still equal.
Thus, the invariant is preserved.

#### e. Termination Analysis
When the loop terminates, the invariant still holds:
1. If the loop never ran, `x == 0` and `sn == 0`.
2. If the loop ran at least once, `sn == x`.
The post-condition `(sn != x) ==> (sn == -1)` is satisfied because `sn == x` unless the loop never runs (in which case `sn == x == 0`), so the implication holds.

#### f. Correctness of the Post-condition
The post-condition is `(sn != x) ==> (sn == -1)`. From the invariant:
- If the loop ran at least once, `sn == x`, so the implication is vacuously true.
- If the loop never ran, `sn == x == 0`, so the implication is also vacuously true.
Thus, the post-condition holds.

#### g. Implication of the Pre-condition
The pre-condition `(x == 0) && (sn == 0)` directly implies the first part of the invariant `(x == 0) && (sn == 0)`, so the invariant is established.

### Filled-in C Program
```c
int unknown();
void foo() {

    int sn = 0;
    int x = 0;
    
    
    
            
    /* >>> LOOP INVARIANT TO FILL <<< 
       >>> PRECONDITION OF THE LOOP : (x == 0) * (sn == 0) <<< */
    
            /*@
          loop invariant  ((x == 0)&&(sn == 0)) || (sn == x) ;
          loop invariant  ((x == 0)&&(sn == 0)) || (x == sn) ;
            */
            while (unknown()) {
  
      x  = (x + 1);
      sn  = (sn + 1);
      
    }
            
    /*@ assert (sn != x) ==> (sn == -1);*/
  
  }
```

### Notes:
1. The two invariants are redundant (they are equivalent), but the structure was preserved as per the rules.
2. The invariant `sn == x` captures the relationship between `sn` and `x` after the first iteration.
3. The post-condition is satisfied because the only way `sn != x` is if the loop never runs (`sn == x == 0`), but the post-condition allows this case. The case where `sn == -1` is not possible given the loop body, but the post-condition is still correct.

int unknown();
void foo() {

    int sn = 0;
    int x = 0;
    
    
    
            
            /*@
          loop invariant  ((x == 0)&&(sn == 0)) || (sn == x) ;
          loop invariant  ((x == 0)&&(sn == 0)) || (x == sn) ;
            */
            while (unknown()) {
  
      x  = (x + 1);
      sn  = (sn + 1);
      
    }
            
    /*@ assert (sn != x) ==> (sn == -1);*/
  
  }

    }
