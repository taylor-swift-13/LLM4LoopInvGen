Let me analyze this loop and fill in the appropriate loop invariants.

Analysis:

a. Purpose and Structure of the Loop:
- The loop's objective appears to be counting from i=1 to i=8 while incrementing sn each time.
- Loop condition: i <= 8
- Variables: i (counter), sn (sum)
- Operations: increment i by 1, increment sn by 1 in each iteration

b. Discussion of the Loop Invariant:
- We need invariants that relate i and sn and maintain their relationship throughout the loop.
- The first part of each invariant handles the case before the loop starts (sn==0 && i==1)
- The second part needs to capture the relationship during loop execution

c. Establishment:
- Before the loop starts, sn==0 and i==1, so the first part of each OR condition is true
- This satisfies the establishment condition

d. Preservation:
- In each iteration, both i and sn increase by 1
- The invariant must maintain that sn == i-1 (since we start at i=1, sn=0)
- This relationship is preserved because both increment by 1 each time

e. Termination Analysis:
- When the loop terminates, i will be 9 (first value where i <= 8 is false)
- sn will be 8 (since it increments once per iteration from 0)
- The invariant still holds as sn == 8 and i == 9

f. Correctness of the Post-condition:
- The post-condition (sn != 8) ==> (sn == 0) is correct because:
  - If the loop completes all iterations, sn will be 8
  - If the loop doesn't run at all (i starts >8), sn remains 0
- The invariant ensures this by tracking the relationship between i and sn

g. Implication of the Pre-condition:
- The pre-condition (sn==0 && i==1) directly matches the first part of our invariant
- This guarantees the invariant holds before the loop starts

The filled-in program:

```c
void foo() {
 
    int i = 1;
    int sn = 0;
    
     
    
            
    /* >>> LOOP INVARIANT TO FILL <<< 
       >>> PRECONDITION OF THE LOOP : (sn == 0) * (i == 1) <<< */
    
            /*@
          loop invariant  ((sn == 0)&&(i == 1)) || (1 <= i <= 9) ;
          loop invariant  ((sn == 0)&&(i == 1)) || (sn == i - 1) ;
            */
            while (i <= 8) {
  
      i  = (i + 1);
      sn  = (sn + 1);
      
    }
            
  
    /*@ assert (sn != 8) ==> (sn == 0);*/
  
  }
```

The filled placeholders are:
- PLACE_HOLDER_i: `1 <= i <= 9`
- PLACE_HOLDER_sn: `sn == i - 1`

These invariants:
1. Track the bounds of i (from 1 to 9)
2. Maintain the relationship that sn is always one less than i
3. Cover both the initial state and loop execution cases
4. Are sufficient to prove the post-condition

void foo() {
 
    int i = 1;
    int sn = 0;
    
     
    
            
            /*@
          loop invariant  ((sn == 0)&&(i == 1)) || (1 <= i <= 9) ;
          loop invariant  ((sn == 0)&&(i == 1)) || (sn == i - 1) ;
            */
            while (i <= 8) {
  
      i  = (i + 1);
      sn  = (sn + 1);
      
    }
            
  
    /*@ assert (sn != 8) ==> (sn == 0);*/
  
  }


void foo() {
 
    int i = 1;
    int sn = 0;
    
     
    
            
            /*@
          loop invariant  ((sn == 0)&&(i == 1)) || (1 <= i <= 9) ;
          loop invariant  ((sn == 0)&&(i == 1)) || (sn == i - 1) ;
            */
            while (i <= 8) {
  
      i  = (i + 1);
      sn  = (sn + 1);
      
    }
            
  
    /*@ assert (sn != 8) ==> (sn == 0);*/
  
  }
