### Analysis

#### a. Purpose and Structure of the Loop
- **Objective**: The loop increments `i` from 1 to 9 (since the loop condition is `i <= 8`) and increments `sn` by 1 in each iteration. The intended outcome is that `sn` will be equal to 8 when the loop terminates, as there are exactly 8 iterations.
- **Structure**: 
  - Loop condition: `i <= 8`
  - Loop body: Increments `i` by 1 and `sn` by 1 in each iteration.
  - Relevant variables: `i` (loop counter), `sn` (sum counter).

#### b. Discussion of the Loop Invariant
The loop invariant must capture the relationship between `i` and `sn` during the loop's execution. Since `sn` starts at 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration, and `i` starts at 1 and increments by 1 in each iteration, the relationship `sn == i - 1` holds at the start and end of each iteration. This is because:
- Before the first iteration: `sn == 0` and `i == 1`, so `sn == i - 1`.
- After each iteration: `sn` and `i` are both incremented by 1, so `sn == i - 1` remains true.

#### c. Establishment
The invariant `(sn == 0 && i == 1) || (sn == i - 1)` is true before the loop starts because the pre-condition `(sn == 0) && (i == 1)` is given, which matches the first part of the invariant (`sn == 0 && i == 1`).

#### d. Preservation
At the start of an iteration where `i <= 8`, assume `sn == i - 1` holds. After the iteration:
- `i` becomes `i + 1`
- `sn` becomes `sn + 1`
Thus, `sn + 1 == (i + 1) - 1` simplifies to `sn + 1 == i`, which is equivalent to `sn == i - 1`. So the invariant `sn == i - 1` is preserved.

#### e. Termination Analysis
When the loop terminates, `i > 8` (specifically, `i == 9` because `i` starts at 1 and increments by 1 until `i > 8`). At this point:
- The invariant `sn == i - 1` holds, so `sn == 9 - 1 == 8`.
- The post-condition `(sn != 0) ==> (sn == 8)` is satisfied because `sn == 8`.

#### f. Correctness of the Post-condition
The post-condition `(sn != 0) ==> (sn == 8)` is correct because:
- The loop invariant `sn == i - 1` holds at termination.
- At termination, `i == 9`, so `sn == 8`.
- Since `sn == 8`, the implication `(sn != 0) ==> (sn == 8)` is true.

#### g. Implication of the Pre-condition
The pre-condition `(sn == 0) && (i == 1)` implies the loop invariant `(sn == 0 && i == 1) || (sn == i - 1)` because the first part of the invariant (`sn == 0 && i == 1`) is exactly the pre-condition.

### Filled-in Loop Invariants
The placeholders are filled as follows:
- `PLACE_HOLDER_i`: `i >= 1 && i <= 9` (bounds for `i`)
- `PLACE_HOLDER_sn`: `sn == i - 1` (relationship between `sn` and `i`)
