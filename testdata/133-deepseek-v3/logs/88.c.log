Let me analyze this loop and fill in the appropriate loop invariants.

Analysis:

a. Purpose and Structure of the Loop:
- Objective: The loop continues until x equals y, and ensures that when it terminates, lock == 1.
- Structure: 
  - Loop condition: x != y
  - Variables: x, y, lock
  - Operations: 
    - If unknown() is true: set lock=1 and x=y
    - Else: set lock=0, x=y, and increment y by 1

b. Discussion of the Loop Invariant:
The invariant needs to track the relationship between x, y and lock to ensure the post-condition (lock == 1) holds.

c. Establishment:
Before the loop starts, we have:
- y == \at(x, Pre) + 1
- lock == 1
- x == \at(x, Pre)
This satisfies the initial invariant conditions.

d. Preservation:
In each iteration:
- If unknown() is true: lock remains 1, x becomes equal to y
- If unknown() is false: lock becomes 0 but y is incremented, maintaining the relationship

e. Termination Analysis:
When x == y, the loop terminates. The invariant ensures that if we exit with x == y, lock must be 1.

f. Correctness of Post-condition:
The invariant ensures that the only way to exit the loop is when lock == 1, which matches the assert.

g. Implication of Pre-condition:
The pre-condition directly establishes the initial invariant state.

Here's the complete program with filled invariants:

```c
int unknown();

int main(int x) {

    int lock = 1;
    int y = x + 1;

    
            
    /* >>> LOOP INVARIANT TO FILL <<< 
       >>> PRECONDITION OF THE LOOP : (y == \at(x, Pre) + 1) * (lock == 1) * (x == \at(x, Pre)) <<< */
    
            /*@
          loop invariant (\at(x, Pre) != \at(x, Pre) + 1) ==> (((y == \at(x, Pre) + 1)&&(lock == 1)&&(x == \at(x, Pre))) || (x == y));
          loop invariant (\at(x, Pre) != \at(x, Pre) + 1) ==> (((y == \at(x, Pre) + 1)&&(lock == 1)&&(x == \at(x, Pre))) || (lock == 1));
          loop invariant (\at(x, Pre) != \at(x, Pre) + 1) ==> (((y == \at(x, Pre) + 1)&&(lock == 1)&&(x == \at(x, Pre))) || (y >= \at(x, Pre) + 1));
          loop invariant (!(\at(x, Pre) != \at(x, Pre) + 1)) ==> ((y == \at(x, Pre) + 1)&&(lock == 1)&&(x == \at(x, Pre)));
            */
            while (x != y) {
        if ( unknown() ) {
          
          lock  = 1;
          x  = y;
          
        } else {
          
          lock  = 0;
          x  = y;
          y  = y + 1;
          
        }
 
    }
            
    /*@ assert lock == 1;*/
  }
```

The filled placeholders are:
- PLACE_HOLDER_x: x == y
- PLACE_HOLDER_lock: lock == 1
- PLACE_HOLDER_y: y >= \at(x, Pre) + 1

These invariants maintain the necessary relationships to prove the post-condition while being as minimal as possible.

### Error Analysis:

The error message indicates a "Goal Preservation of Invariant" failure for the first loop invariant at line 12. The specific issue is that Frama-C cannot prove that the invariant `(\at(x, Pre) != \at(x, Pre) + 1) ==> (((y == \at(x, Pre) + 1)&&(lock == 1)&&(x == \at(x, Pre))) || (x == y))` is preserved through loop iterations.

The problematic part is the `x == y` disjunct, which becomes false during loop execution (since the loop condition is `x != y`), but the rest of the invariant doesn't properly account for the state changes in the loop body.

Looking at the loop behavior:
1. In both branches of the `if` statement, `x` is set to `y`
2. In the else branch, `y` is incremented and `lock` is set to 0
3. The loop continues until `x == y`

The current invariant is too strict. We need to weaken it to account for:
- The case where `lock` might be 0 (in else branch)
- The case where `y` might be greater than `x+1` (after multiple else branches)
- The fact that `x` will equal `y` at loop termination

### Fixed C Code:

```c
int unknown();

int main(int x) {

    int lock = 1;
    int y = x + 1;

    
            
            /*@
          loop invariant (\at(x, Pre) != \at(x, Pre) + 1) ==> (((y == \at(x, Pre) + 1)&&(lock == 1)&&(x == \at(x, Pre))) || (y >= x && (lock == 0 || lock == 1)));
          loop invariant (\at(x, Pre) != \at(x, Pre) + 1) ==> (((y == \at(x, Pre) + 1)&&(lock == 1)&&(x == \at(x, Pre))) || (lock == 1));
          loop invariant (\at(x, Pre) != \at(x, Pre) + 1) ==> (((y == \at(x, Pre) + 1)&&(lock == 1)&&(x == \at(x, Pre))) || (y >= \at(x, Pre) + 1));
          loop invariant (!(\at(x, Pre) != \at(x, Pre) + 1)) ==> ((y == \at(x, Pre) + 1)&&(lock == 1)&&(x == \at(x, Pre)));
            */
            while (x != y) {
        if ( unknown() ) {
          
          lock  = 1;
          x  = y;
          
        } else {
          
          lock  = 0;
          x  = y;
          y  = y + 1;
          
        }
 
    }
            
    /*@ assert lock == 1;*/
  }
```

Key changes made:
1. Replaced `(x == y)` with `(y >= x && (lock == 0 || lock == 1))` in the first invariant to:
   - Allow for `y` to grow beyond initial value
   - Account for possible `lock` values during execution
   - Still maintain the relationship between x and y
2. Kept other invariants as they were properly handling their respective cases

This weaker invariant:
- Still establishes the initial condition (first branch of implication)
- Preserves through both branches of the if statement
- Allows for the loop to terminate properly
- Still proves the final assertion `lock == 1` (as the else branch can't be taken indefinitely because y keeps increasing until x == y)

Let me analyze the error and provide a solution.

1. Error Analysis:

The error occurs in the preservation of the second loop invariant regarding the `lock` variable. The current invariant states that either:
- The initial conditions hold (y == x+1, lock == 1, x unchanged), OR
- lock == 1

However, the loop body can set lock to 0 in the else branch, which violates this invariant. The error message shows that Frama-C cannot prove this invariant preservation when lock becomes 0.

The issue is that the invariant is too strict - it requires lock to always be 1, but the code explicitly allows it to become 0. We need to weaken this invariant to match the actual behavior of the loop.

2. Fixed C Code:

```c
int unknown();

int main(int x) {

    int lock = 1;
    int y = x + 1;

          x  = y;
          y  = y + 1;
          
        }
 
    }
            
    /*@ assert lock == 1;*/
  }
```

The key change is in the second loop invariant, where I replaced `(lock == 1)` with `(lock == 0 || lock == 1)`. This now correctly reflects that lock can be either 0 or 1 during loop execution, while still allowing us to prove the final assertion that lock == 1 when the loop terminates (since the loop only terminates when x == y, which can only happen in the if branch where lock is set to 1).

The other invariants remain unchanged as they were not causing verification issues. The first invariant correctly tracks the relationship between x and y, and the third invariant maintains that y is always at least x+1 when we're not in the initial state.

Error line content: /*@ assert lock == 1;*/

Let me analyze the error and provide a solution.

Error Analysis:
1. The error shows that Frama-C cannot prove the postcondition `lock == 1` at the end of the loop.
2. The current invariants allow `lock` to be either 0 or 1 during the loop, which is too weak to guarantee it will be 1 at termination.
3. We need to strengthen the invariants to ensure that when the loop terminates (x == y), the lock must be 1.
4. Looking at the loop body, we can see that lock is set to 1 when we take the first branch (unknown() returns true), and set to 0 otherwise. However, when we take the second branch, y is incremented, so x will never catch up to y unless we take the first branch.

Fixed C Code:
```c
int unknown();

int main(int x) {

    int lock = 1;
    int y = x + 1;

    
            
            /*@
          loop invariant (\at(x, Pre) != \at(x, Pre) + 1) ==> (((y == \at(x, Pre) + 1)&&(lock == 1)&&(x == \at(x, Pre))) || (y >= x && (lock == 0 || lock == 1)));
          loop invariant (\at(x, Pre) != \at(x, Pre) + 1) ==> (((y == \at(x, Pre) + 1)&&(lock == 1)&&(x == \at(x, Pre))) || (lock == 0 || lock == 1));
          loop invariant (\at(x, Pre) != \at(x, Pre) + 1) ==> (((y == \at(x, Pre) + 1)&&(lock == 1)&&(x == \at(x, Pre))) || (y >= \at(x, Pre) + 1));
          loop invariant (!(\at(x, Pre) != \at(x, Pre) + 1)) ==> ((y == \at(x, Pre) + 1)&&(lock == 1)&&(x == \at(x, Pre)));
          loop invariant x != y ==> (y > x);
          loop invariant x == y ==> lock == 1;
            */
            while (x != y) {
        if ( unknown() ) {
          
          lock  = 1;
          x  = y;
          
        } else {
          
          lock  = 0;
          x  = y;
          y  = y + 1;
          
        }
 
    }
            
    /*@ assert lock == 1;*/
  }
```

Key Changes:
1. Added `loop invariant x != y ==> (y > x);` to capture that y is always ahead of x during loop execution.
2. Added `loop invariant x == y ==> lock == 1;` which is crucial - it states that the only way the loop can terminate (x == y) is if lock is 1. This directly supports the postcondition.

These new invariants properly capture the program's behavior:
- During execution (x != y), y is always greater than x
- The loop can only terminate when lock is 1 (which happens in the first branch)
- The second branch always increases y, maintaining y > x until we take the first branch

The original invariants are preserved, but we've added stronger conditions that properly constrain the relationship between x, y and lock to ensure the postcondition holds.
