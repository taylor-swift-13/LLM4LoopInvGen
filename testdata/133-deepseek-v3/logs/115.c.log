### Analysis

#### a. Purpose and Structure of the Loop
The loop's objective is to increment both `x` and `sn` by 1 in each iteration until an unknown condition (determined by `unknown()`) is no longer satisfied. The intended outcome is that `sn` and `x` remain equal after the loop terminates, as indicated by the post-condition `(sn != -1) ==> (sn == x)`.

The loop structure:
- **Loop condition**: `unknown()` (number of iterations is arbitrary, but finite).
- **Loop body**: Increments `x` and `sn` by 1 in each iteration.
- **Relevant variables**: `x` (counter), `sn` (sum).

#### b. Discussion of the Loop Invariant
The proposed loop invariant is:
1. `((x == 0) && (sn == 0)) || (PLACE_HOLDER_sn)`: At the start or end of any iteration, either the loop hasn't started (`x == 0 && sn == 0`), or `sn` has been incremented in lockstep with `x`.
2. `((x == 0) && (sn == 0)) || (PLACE_HOLDER_x)`: Similarly for `x`.

The invariant must capture that `sn` and `x` are always equal if the loop has started. This is valid because:
- Before the loop starts, `x == 0 && sn == 0`.
- In each iteration, both `x` and `sn` are incremented by 1, preserving their equality.

#### c. Establishment
Before the loop starts, the pre-condition `(x == 0) && (sn == 0)` holds. Thus, the first part of the invariant `(x == 0) && (sn == 0)` is true, satisfying the establishment condition.

#### d. Preservation
At the start of an iteration, if the loop has run at least once, the invariant implies `sn == x`. In the loop body, both `x` and `sn` are incremented by 1, so `sn == x` remains true. If the loop hasn't run (`x == 0 && sn == 0`), the first iteration will set `x = 1` and `sn = 1`, making `sn == x` true.

#### e. Termination Analysis
When the loop terminates (i.e., `unknown()` returns false), the invariant still holds:
- If the loop never ran, `x == 0 && sn == 0`.
- If the loop ran at least once, `sn == x`.

The post-condition `(sn != -1) ==> (sn == x)` is satisfied because:
- If `sn != -1`, then the loop must have run (since `sn` starts at 0 and is only incremented), so `sn == x`.

#### f. Correctness of the Post-condition
The post-condition follows from the invariant:
- If the loop never ran, `sn == 0` and `x == 0`, so `sn == x`.
- If the loop ran, `sn == x` by the invariant. Since `sn` is never decremented, `sn != -1` is always true, so `sn == x` holds.

#### g. Implication of the Pre-condition
The pre-condition `(x == 0) && (sn == 0)` directly implies the first part of the invariant `(x == 0) && (sn == 0)`, establishing the invariant before the loop starts.

### Filled-in Loop Invariants
The placeholders should be filled as follows:
- `PLACE_HOLDER_sn`: `sn == x`
- `PLACE_HOLDER_x`: `sn == x`

### Complete Program with Filled Invariants
```c
int unknown();
void foo() {
    int sn = 0;
    int x = 0;
    
    /*@
      loop invariant ((x == 0) && (sn == 0)) || (sn == x);
      loop invariant ((x == 0) && (sn == 0)) || (sn == x);
    */
    while (unknown()) {
        x = (x + 1);
        sn = (sn + 1);
    }
    
    /*@ assert (sn != -1) ==> (sn == x); */
}
```

### Explanation of Filled Invariants
- The invariant `((x == 0) && (sn == 0)) || (sn == x)` captures that either:
  1. The loop hasn't started (`x == 0 && sn == 0`), or
  2. `sn` and `x` are equal (which remains true after each iteration).
- The second identical invariant is redundant but preserved as per the original structure. In practice, one invariant would suffice.

int unknown();
void foo() {
    int sn = 0;
    int x = 0;
    
    /*@
      loop invariant ((x == 0) && (sn == 0)) || (sn == x);
      loop invariant ((x == 0) && (sn == 0)) || (sn == x);
    */
    while (unknown()) {
        x = (x + 1);
        sn = (sn + 1);
    }
    
    /*@ assert (sn != -1) ==> (sn == x); */
}


int unknown();
void foo() {
    int sn = 0;
    int x = 0;
    
    /*@
      loop invariant ((x == 0) && (sn == 0)) || (sn == x);
      loop invariant ((x == 0) && (sn == 0)) || (sn == x);
    */
    while (unknown()) {
        x = (x + 1);
        sn = (sn + 1);
    }
    
    /*@ assert (sn != -1) ==> (sn == x); */
}
