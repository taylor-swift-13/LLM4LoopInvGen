### Analysis

#### a. Purpose and Structure of the Loop
- **Objective**: The loop's intended outcome is not entirely clear from the given code, but it appears to be incrementing `y` by `x` in each iteration while `y` remains non-negative. The post-condition `y >= 0` suggests that the loop should ensure `y` never becomes negative (though the loop condition `y >= 0` would terminate if `y` becomes negative).
- **Structure**: 
  - **Loop Condition**: `y >= 0`.
  - **Loop Body**: `y = y + x;`.
  - **Relevant Variables**: `x` and `y`. `x` is initialized to `0` and never modified in the loop. `y` is initialized to `0` and updated in each iteration by adding `x` to it.

#### b. Discussion of the Loop Invariant
- **Proposed Loop Invariant**: 
  - `((y == 0) && (x == 0)) || (PLACE_HOLDER_y)`: This suggests that either `y` and `x` are both `0`, or some condition on `y` holds.
  - `x == 0`: This is straightforward since `x` is never modified.
- **Why Valid**: The invariant must capture the state of `y` and `x` throughout the loop. Since `x` is always `0`, `y` remains unchanged in each iteration (`y = y + 0`). Thus, `y` is always `0`.

#### c. Establishment
- Before the loop starts, `y == 0` and `x == 0` (from the pre-condition). Thus, the first part of the invariant `(y == 0) && (x == 0)` holds, satisfying the establishment condition.

#### d. Preservation
- At the start of an iteration, assume the invariant holds. Since `x == 0`, the assignment `y = y + x` simplifies to `y = y + 0`, so `y` does not change. Thus, the invariant remains true after the iteration.

#### e. Termination Analysis
- The loop terminates when `y < 0`. However, since `y` is always `0` (due to `x == 0`), the loop condition `y >= 0` is always true, and the loop never terminates. This is a problem, but the post-condition `y >= 0` would trivially hold if the loop somehow terminated (which it doesn't).

#### f. Correctness of the Post-condition
- The post-condition `y >= 0` is implied by the invariant `y == 0` (since `x == 0` ensures `y` never changes). If the loop terminated, `y` would still be `0`, satisfying `y >= 0`.

#### g. Implication of the Pre-condition
- The pre-condition `(y == 0) && (x == 0)` directly implies the invariant `(y == 0) && (x == 0)`, which is the first part of the disjunctive invariant. Thus, the pre-condition establishes the invariant.

### Filled-in Loop Invariant
The placeholder `PLACE_HOLDER_y` should be `y == 0` because `y` never changes (since `x == 0`). The complete invariant is:
```c
loop invariant ((y == 0) && (x == 0)) || (y == 0);
loop invariant x == 0;
```

### Complete Program with Filled Invariants
```c
void foo() {
    int x = 0;
    int y = 0;

    /* >>> LOOP INVARIANT TO FILL <<< 
       >>> PRECONDITION OF THE LOOP : (y == 0) * (x == 0) <<< */
    
    /*@
      loop invariant ((y == 0) && (x == 0)) || (y == 0);
      loop invariant x == 0;
    */
    while(y >= 0) {
        y = y + x;
    }
            
    /*@ assert y >= 0;*/
}
```

### Notes
- The loop never terminates because `y` is always `0` and `y >= 0` is always true. This is likely a bug in the program, but the invariant correctly captures the behavior.
- The post-condition `y >= 0` is trivial because the loop cannot terminate (unless `y` is modified elsewhere, which it isn't).

void foo() {
    int x = 0;
    int y = 0;

    /*@
      loop invariant ((y == 0) && (x == 0)) || (y == 0);
      loop invariant x == 0;
    */
    while(y >= 0) {
        y = y + x;
    }
            
    /*@ assert y >= 0;*/
}


void foo() {
    int x = 0;
    int y = 0;

    /*@
      loop invariant ((y == 0) && (x == 0)) || (y == 0);
      loop invariant x == 0;
    */
    while(y >= 0) {
        y = y + x;
    }
            
    /*@ assert y >= 0;*/
