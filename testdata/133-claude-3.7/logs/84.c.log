<think>Let me analyze this C program to determine the appropriate loop invariants. The program contains a loop where variables x and y are modified. Let's break down the program and understand its behavior:

Pre-condition: `(x == -50) * (y == \at(y, Pre))`
This means x starts at -50 and y starts at its initial value (represented by \at(y, Pre)).

Loop behavior:
- The loop runs while x < 0
- In each iteration, x is incremented by y
- In each iteration, y is incremented by 1

I need to find loop invariants that replace PLACE_HOLDER_y and PLACE_HOLDER_x in:
```
loop invariant ((x == -50)&&(y == \at(y, Pre))) || (PLACE_HOLDER_y);
loop invariant ((x == -50)&&(y == \at(y, Pre))) || (PLACE_HOLDER_x);
```

The postcondition is `y > 0`.

Let's think through the loop execution:
- Initially, x = -50 and y = y_init (where y_init = \at(y, Pre))
- After first iteration: x = -50 + y_init, y = y_init + 1
- After second iteration: x = -50 + y_init + (y_init + 1), y = y_init + 2
- After third iteration: x = -50 + y_init + (y_init + 1) + (y_init + 2), y = y_init + 3
- And so on...

I need to find relationships between x and y that hold throughout the loop execution.

Let's try to express x in terms of y:
- After n iterations, y = y_init + n
- So n = y - y_init
- After n iterations, x = -50 + Σ(y_init + i) for i from 0 to n-1
- This can be written as x = -50 + n*y_init + Σi for i from 0 to n-1
- The sum of the first n-1 natural numbers is (n-1)*n/2
- So x = -50 + n*y_init + (n-1)*n/2
- Substituting n = y - y_init:
  x = -50 + (y - y_init)*y_init + (y - y_init - 1)*(y - y_init)/2
  = -50 + y*y_init - y_init^2 + (y - y_init)^2/2 - (y - y_init)/2
  = -50 + y*y_init - y_init^2 + (y^2 - 2*y*y_init + y_init^2)/2 - (y - y_init)/2
  
This is getting complicated, so let me try a different approach.

Let's find a simpler relationship between x and y. The loop terminates when x becomes non-negative. Let's track how x changes:
- Initially, x = -50
- Each iteration adds the current value of y to x
- y increases by 1 each iteration

If y starts positive, x will increase faster in each iteration. If y starts negative but small enough in magnitude, eventually y will become positive and x will start increasing faster.

For the postcondition to be true (y > 0), either:
1. y_init > 0, so y remains positive throughout
2. y_init ≤ 0, but the loop runs long enough that y becomes positive

Since the loop runs until x ≥ 0, we need y to be positive when that happens. Let's determine when x becomes non-negative.

Let me try another approach: compute directly what happens after k iterations:
- After k iterations, y = y_init + k
- After k iterations, x = -50 + Σ(y_init + i) for i from 0 to k-1
  = -50 + k*y_init + k*(k-1)/2

The loop terminates when x ≥ 0, i.e., when:
-50 + k*y_init + k*(k-1)/2 ≥ 0

Let's simplify this inequality:
k*(k-1)/2 + k*y_init ≥ 50
k^2/2 - k/2 + k*y_init ≥ 50
k^2/2 + k*(y_init - 1/2) ≥ 50

This gives us a quadratic inequality that determines the minimum number of iterations needed.

For the invariant, I need to figure out:
1. What is the relationship between x and y at any point during the loop?
2. What bounds can we establish for x and y?

Let me work on finding the invariants:

For PLACE_HOLDER_y:
After the loop has run for some iterations, y has increased from its initial value. So y > \at(y, Pre) if the loop has executed at least once.

For PLACE_HOLDER_x:
There's a relationship between x, y, and the initial value of y. 
If we denote k as the number of iterations executed so far, then:
- y = y_init + k
- x = -50 + Σ(y_init + i) from i=0 to k-1
  = -50 + k*y_init + k*(k-1)/2

Eliminating k: k = y - y_init
So x = -50 + (y - y_init)*y_init + (y - y_init)*((y - y_init)-1)/2
x = -50 + y*y_init - y_init^2 + (y - y_init)*(y - y_init - 1)/2

This can be simplified to:
x = -50 + y*y_init - y_init^2 + (y - y_init)^2/2 - (y - y_init)/2

Let's double-check this with a simple example:
If y_init = 10 and we run 3 iterations:
- y = 13
- x should be -50 + 10 + (10+1) + (10+2) = -50 + 10 + 11 + 12 = -17

Using our formula:
x = -50 + 13*10 - 10^2 + (13-10)^2/2 - (13-10)/2
  = -50 + 130 - 100 + 9/2 - 3/2
  = -50 + 130 - 100 + 4.5 - 1.5
  = -50 + 130 - 100 + 3
  = -17 ✓

So our invariant for x should be:
x = -50 + y*(\at(y, Pre)) - (\at(y, Pre))^2 + (y - \at(y, Pre))*(y - \at(y, Pre) - 1)/2

Let's simplify this further:
x = -50 + y*y_init - y_init^2 + (y - y_init)*(y - y_init - 1)/2
x = -50 + y*y_init - y_init^2 + (y - y_init)^2/2 - (y - y_init)/2

Since our invariant is after "||", which means it applies when the first part is false, I'll write:
PLACE_HOLDER_y: y > \at(y, Pre)
PLACE_HOLDER_x: x = -50 + y*\at(y, Pre) - \at(y, Pre)^2 + (y - \at(y, Pre))*(y - \at(y, Pre) - 1)/2</think>

# Loop Invariant Analysis for the C Program

## a. Purpose and Structure of the Loop

The loop's purpose is to increment variable `x` (which starts at -50) by the current value of `y` in each iteration, while also incrementing `y` by 1 each time, until `x` becomes non-negative.

**Loop structure:**
- Loop condition: `x < 0`
- Operations in the loop body:
  - `x = x + y`
  - `y = y + 1`
- Relevant variables: `x` and `y`

## b. Discussion of the Loop Invariant

I'll propose two invariants:
1. For tracking the relationship between the current value of `y` and its initial value
2. For establishing the mathematical relationship between `x` and `y` during loop execution

## c. Establishment

Initially, before the loop executes, `x = -50` and `y = \at(y, Pre)`. This makes the first part of both invariants `((x == -50)&&(y == \at(y, Pre)))` true, which means both invariants are established.

## d. Preservation

For each iteration:
- `y` increases by 1, which maintains our first invariant's relationship
- `x` is updated based on the current value of `y`, maintaining the mathematical relationship described in our second invariant

## e. Termination Analysis

The loop terminates when `x ≥ 0`. Since `x` increases by the current value of `y` in each iteration, and `y` increases by 1 each time, eventually `x` will become non-negative.

## f. Correctness of the Post-condition

The post-condition is `y > 0`. For the loop to terminate, `x` must become non-negative. If the initial value of `y` is positive, then `y` will remain positive throughout. If the initial value of `y` is non-positive, then `y` will need to increase enough times to make `x` non-negative, which will also make `y` positive.

## g. Implication of the Pre-condition

The pre-condition `(x == -50) * (y == \at(y, Pre))` establishes the initial state that directly corresponds to the first part of both invariants, ensuring they're true before the loop begins.

## Complete C Program with Filled Invariants

```c
void foo(int y) {

    int x = -50;
  
    
    
            
    /* >>> LOOP INVARIANT TO FILL <<< 
       >>> PRECONDITION OF THE LOOP : (x == -50) * (y == \at(y, Pre)) <<< */
    
            /*@
          loop invariant  ((x == -50)&&(y == \at(y, Pre))) || (y > \at(y, Pre)) ;
          loop invariant  ((x == -50)&&(y == \at(y, Pre))) || (x == -50 + (y - \at(y, Pre)) * \at(y, Pre) + (y - \at(y, Pre)) * (y - \at(y, Pre) - 1) / 2) ;
            */
            while (x < 0) {
      
      x  = x + y;
      y  = y + 1;
      
  
    }
            
    /*@ assert y > 0; */
  
  }
```

The first invariant states that either we haven't entered the loop yet, or `y` has increased from its initial value.

The second invariant captures the exact mathematical relationship between `x` and `y` during loop execution. It expresses that `x` equals its initial value (-50) plus the sum of all values of `y` encountered during iterations.

void foo(int y) {

    int x = -50;
  
    
    
            
            /*@
          loop invariant  ((x == -50)&&(y == \at(y, Pre))) || (y > \at(y, Pre)) ;
          loop invariant  ((x == -50)&&(y == \at(y, Pre))) || (x == -50 + (y - \at(y, Pre)) * \at(y, Pre) + (y - \at(y, Pre)) * (y - \at(y, Pre) - 1) / 2) ;
            */
            while (x < 0) {
      
      x  = x + y;
      y  = y + 1;
      
  
    }
            
    /*@ assert y > 0; */
  
  }


void foo(int y) {

    int x = -50;
  
    
    
            
            /*@
          loop invariant  ((x == -50)&&(y == \at(y, Pre))) || (y > \at(y, Pre)) ;
          loop invariant  ((x == -50)&&(y == \at(y, Pre))) || (x == -50 + (y - \at(y, Pre)) * \at(y, Pre) + (y - \at(y, Pre)) * (y - \at(y, Pre) - 1) / 2) ;
            */
            while (x < 0) {
      
      x  = x + y;
      y  = y + 1;
      
  
    }
            
    /*@ assert y > 0; */
  
  }
