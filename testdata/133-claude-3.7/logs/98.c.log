<think>Let me analyze this C program with a loop and determine the loop invariants needed for Frama-C verification.

First, let's understand what the code does:

```c
void foo(int x) {
    int i = 0;
    int j = 0;
    int y = 2;
    
    // Loop with invariants to fill
    while (i <= x) {
        i = i + 1;
        j = j + y;
    }
    
    /*@ assert (i != j) ==> (y != 1) ;*/
}
```

The pre-condition is: `(y == 2) * (j == 0) * (i == 0) * (x == \at(x, Pre))`
This means:
- y is initialized to 2
- j is initialized to 0
- i is initialized to 0
- x maintains its initial value (from the function parameter)

The loop increments i by 1 and j by y (which is 2) in each iteration, until i > x.

The post-condition (assertion) is: `(i != j) ==> (y != 1)`
This means: if i is not equal to j, then y is not equal to 1.

Now, I need to fill in the placeholders for the loop invariants:

```
loop invariant (0 <= \at(x, Pre)) ==> (((y == 2)&&(j == 0)&&(i == 0)&&(x == \at(x, Pre))) || (PLACE_HOLDER_i));
loop invariant (0 <= \at(x, Pre)) ==> (((y == 2)&&(j == 0)&&(i == 0)&&(x == \at(x, Pre))) || (PLACE_HOLDER_j));
loop invariant (!(0 <= \at(x, Pre))) ==> ((y == 2)&&(j == 0)&&(i == 0)&&(x == \at(x, Pre)));
loop invariant y == 2;
loop invariant x == \at(x, Pre);
```

Let's reason through what PLACE_HOLDER_i and PLACE_HOLDER_j should be:

In the loop, i starts at 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration until i > x.
So after n iterations (if the loop runs), i will have the value n.
If the loop doesn't run (when x < 0), i remains 0.

Similarly, j starts at 0 and increments by y (which is 2) in each iteration.
After n iterations, j will be n*2.

Now let's think about what the invariants are trying to express:

1. The first invariant has a condition: `(0 <= \at(x, Pre))`. This means if x ≥ 0, then either:
   - We're at the start of the loop (y=2, j=0, i=0, x=\at(x, Pre))
   - Or something about i (PLACE_HOLDER_i)

2. The second invariant also has `(0 <= \at(x, Pre))` condition, and is similar but about j.

3. The third invariant says if x < 0, then we're still at the initial state (which makes sense because the loop won't execute).

4. The last two invariants simply state that y and x don't change.

Let's determine what should go in PLACE_HOLDER_i and PLACE_HOLDER_j:

For PLACE_HOLDER_i: We need an expression that describes i during any iteration of the loop. Since i starts at 0 and increments by 1 each time, and the loop runs as long as i ≤ x, we know that 0 ≤ i ≤ x+1. At the final iteration, i will become x+1. So PLACE_HOLDER_i should be: `(0 < i) && (i <= x+1)`

For PLACE_HOLDER_j: Since j starts at 0 and increases by 2 in each iteration, and i increases by 1, we know that j = 2*i at each point. So PLACE_HOLDER_j should be: `j == 2*i`

Let me check these:

1. Establishment: Before the loop, i=0 and j=0, so i is not > 0, thus the first part of the disjunction in the first two invariants is true.

2. Preservation: If i > 0 and i ≤ x+1 and j = 2*i, then after one more iteration, i becomes i+1 and j becomes j+2, which maintains j = 2*i, and i will still be > 0 and ≤ x+1 as long as the loop condition is true.

3. Termination: When the loop terminates, i > x, which means i = x+1, and j = 2*i = 2*(x+1). The invariants still hold.

4. Correctness of post-condition: The post-condition is (i != j) ==> (y != 1). We know from our invariant that j = 2*i, so i != j is always true unless i = 0 (which could happen if the loop doesn't run at all). And we have y = 2, so y != 1 is always true. Thus, the implication is always true.

Let me fine-tune the invariants:

PLACE_HOLDER_i: `(0 < i) && (i <= x+1)`
PLACE_HOLDER_j: `j == 2*i`

This seems correct, but let me double-check by tracing through some examples:

For x = 3:
- Initial: i=0, j=0, y=2
- After 1st iteration: i=1, j=2, y=2 (i ≤ x, j = 2*i)
- After 2nd iteration: i=2, j=4, y=2 (i ≤ x, j = 2*i)
- After 3rd iteration: i=3, j=6, y=2 (i ≤ x, j = 2*i)
- After 4th iteration: i=4, j=8, y=2 (i > x, loop ends)
- Final: i=4, j=8, y=2
- Post-condition: (4 != 8) ==> (2 != 1), which is true

For x = -1:
- The loop doesn't run, so i=0, j=0, y=2
- Post-condition: (0 != 0) ==> (2 != 1), which is true because the antecedent is false

Actually, I need to consider more carefully. If x = -1, then i = 0, j = 0, and i != j is false. So the post-condition is checking a false implication, which is vacuously true.

But let me reconsider PLACE_HOLDER_i again. When the loop terminates, we know i > x (the negation of the loop condition). But we also know that the last value of i was incremented from a value that satisfied the loop condition. So if x ≥ 0, i will have gone from 0 to x+1. So the invariant should be: `(0 <= i) && (i <= x+1)`.

And for PLACE_HOLDER_j, we need to consider the relationship between i and j. We now know j = 2*i at all points. So PLACE_HOLDER_j should be: `j == 2*i`.

Let me verify this with the examples again:

For x = 3:
- Final: i=4, j=8, y=2
- j = 2*i? Yes, 8 = 2*4

For x = -1:
- The loop doesn't run, so i=0, j=0, y=2
- j = 2*i? Yes, 0 = 2*0

Actually, our invariant works for both examples, so I think it's correct.

PLACE_HOLDER_i: `(0 <= i) && (i <= x+1)`
PLACE_HOLDER_j: `j == 2*i`</think>

# Loop Invariant Analysis for C Program

I'll analyze the provided C program and develop appropriate loop invariants for Frama-C verification.

## Analysis

### a. Purpose and Structure of the Loop

The loop's purpose is to increment `i` by 1 and `j` by 2 (the value of `y`) for each iteration until `i` exceeds `x`. This creates a relationship where `j` is always twice the value of `i` during and after the loop's execution.

The loop condition is `i <= x`, and within the body:
- `i` is incremented by 1
- `j` is incremented by `y` (which is always 2)

Relevant variables are `i`, `j`, `y`, and `x`.

### b. Discussion of the Loop Invariant

The proposed loop invariants are:
1. A relationship for `i` when `x ≥ 0`
2. A relationship for `j` when `x ≥ 0`
3. A condition for when `x < 0` (loop doesn't execute)
4. `y` remains constant
5. `x` remains constant

These invariants together capture the relationships between variables at each iteration and handle both cases when the loop executes (x ≥ 0) and when it doesn't (x < 0).

### c. Establishment

Before the loop begins, according to the precondition, we have:
- `y == 2`
- `j == 0`
- `i == 0`
- `x == \at(x, Pre)`

When `x < 0`, the loop doesn't execute, and the initial values are maintained.
When `x ≥ 0`, the first iteration begins with the initial values, which satisfy our invariants.

### d. Preservation

For each iteration:
- `i` increases by 1, maintaining `0 ≤ i ≤ x+1`
- `j` increases by 2, maintaining `j = 2*i`
- `y` and `x` remain unchanged

These relationships hold through each iteration as long as the loop condition `i <= x` is true.

### e. Termination Analysis

The loop terminates when `i > x`. At this point:
- If `x < 0`, then `i = 0`, `j = 0` (the loop never executed)
- If `x ≥ 0`, then `i = x+1` and `j = 2*(x+1)`

Our invariants still hold at termination.

### f. Correctness of the Post-condition

The post-condition `(i != j) ==> (y != 1)` is guaranteed because:
- We know `y == 2` (from our invariant), so `y != 1` is always true
- When `x ≥ 0`, `i = x+1` and `j = 2*(x+1)`, so `i != j` unless `x+1 = 0` (impossible when `x ≥ 0`)
- When `x < 0`, `i = 0` and `j = 0`, so `i = j` and the implication is vacuously true

### g. Implication of the Pre-condition

The pre-condition `(y == 2) * (j == 0) * (i == 0) * (x == \at(x, Pre))` directly establishes the initial values that our invariants depend on. These values are exactly what's needed to satisfy the invariants before the loop begins execution.
