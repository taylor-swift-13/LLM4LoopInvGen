<think>Let me analyze this C program with its loop and determine the appropriate loop invariants to fill in.

The program initializes two variables `i = 1` and `sn = 0`. Then it has a loop that increments both `i` and `sn` by 1 in each iteration until `i > n`.

The pre-condition is: `(sn == 0) * (i == 1) * (n == \at(n, Pre))`
This means initially:
- `sn` is 0
- `i` is 1
- `n` is the same as its initial value

The post-condition is: `(sn!= n) ==> (sn ==0)`
This means if `sn` is not equal to `n`, then `sn` must be 0.

Let me understand the loop's behavior:

1. If `n < 1`, the loop doesn't execute at all, so we have the initial values `i = 1` and `sn = 0`
2. If `n >= 1`, both `i` and `sn` increment at each iteration.
   - After the first iteration: `i = 2`, `sn = 1`
   - After the second iteration: `i = 3`, `sn = 2`
   - And so on until `i > n`

The loop will increment both `i` and `sn` exactly `n` times (assuming `n >= 1`), meaning that after the loop:
- If `n >= 1`: `i` will be `n+1` and `sn` will be `n`
- If `n < 1`: `i` will remain 1 and `sn` will remain 0

Now, let's fill in the placeholders:

For `PLACE_HOLDER_i`, I need to define the relationship between `i` and other variables when the loop condition is met. Since `i` starts at 1 and increases by 1 each iteration, at any point in the loop `i` should be between 1 and `n+1`:
`(1 <= i <= n+1)`

For `PLACE_HOLDER_sn`, I need to define the relationship between `sn` and other variables. Since `sn` starts at 0 and also increases by 1 each iteration, at any point in the loop `sn` should be between 0 and `n`:
`(0 <= sn <= n)`

But looking more closely at the loop's behavior, we can observe that at any point during the loop execution: `sn = i - 1`. So a more precise invariant would be:
`(sn == i - 1)`

But the required format allows me to use the given structure and just fill in the placeholders. Let me see how to best fit these insights into the template.

Looking at the structure:
```
(1 <= \at(n, Pre)) ==> (((sn == 0)&&(i == 1)&&(n == \at(n, Pre))) || (PLACE_HOLDER_i))
```

This means "if n ≥ 1, then either we're in the initial state OR the placeholder condition holds". The placeholder condition should describe the state during loop execution.

So for `PLACE_HOLDER_i`, I should use: `(1 < i <= n+1) && (n == \at(n, Pre))`
For `PLACE_HOLDER_sn`, I should use: `(0 < sn <= n) && (sn == i-1) && (n == \at(n, Pre))`

Actually, I notice the third invariant already ensures `n == \at(n, Pre)` always holds, so I can simplify these to:
For `PLACE_HOLDER_i`: `(1 < i <= n+1)`
For `PLACE_HOLDER_sn`: `(0 < sn <= n) && (sn == i-1)`

Let's double-check these invariants:

1. Establishment: Before the loop, `i = 1` and `sn = 0`. The first clause of the invariant `((sn == 0)&&(i == 1)&&(n == \at(n, Pre)))` is true, so both invariants are established.

2. Preservation: Assuming the invariants hold at the start of an iteration and the loop condition `i <= n` is true:
   - After the iteration, `i` becomes `i+1` and `sn` becomes `sn+1`.
   - For the first invariant, since `i <= n` was true, `i+1 <= n+1` is also true.
   - For the second invariant, `sn+1 <= n` is true when `sn < n`, which is true when `i <= n`. Also, `sn+1 == (i+1)-1`, so the relationship holds.

3. Termination: When the loop terminates, `i > n`. This means `i = n+1` and `sn = n` (if n ≥ 1).

Let me finalize the loop invariants:

For `PLACE_HOLDER_i`: `(1 < i <= n+1)`
For `PLACE_HOLDER_sn`: `(0 < sn <= n) && (sn == i-1)`</think>

# Analysis of C Program with Loop Invariants

## Purpose and Structure of the Loop

This program calculates a value `sn` based on the input `n`. The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i = n`, incrementing both `i` and `sn` by 1 in each iteration. If `n >= 1`, after the loop completes, `sn` will equal `n`. If `n < 1`, the loop doesn't execute at all, and `sn` remains 0.

The loop is controlled by the condition `i <= n`. Inside the loop body, both `i` and `sn` are incremented by 1 in each iteration. The relevant variables are `i`, `sn`, and `n`.

## Discussion of the Loop Invariant

The proposed loop invariants establish the relationship between the variables during loop execution:

1. For `i`: When `n >= 1`, either we're at the initial state, or `i` is between 2 and `n+1` inclusive during loop execution
2. For `sn`: When `n >= 1`, either we're at the initial state, or `sn` is between 1 and `n` inclusive and maintains the relationship `sn == i-1`
3. For the case where `n < 1`, the invariant ensures variables remain in their initial state
4. `n` remains constant throughout the function execution

## Establishment

The invariants are established before the loop begins because:
- When `n >= 1`: The initial values `sn == 0` and `i == 1` satisfy the left side of the OR condition in both invariants
- When `n < 1`: The initial values satisfy the condition directly

## Preservation

Assuming the invariants hold at the start of an iteration and the loop condition `i <= n` is true:
- After each iteration, `i` increases by 1, ensuring `1 < i <= n+1`
- After each iteration, `sn` increases by 1, ensuring `0 < sn <= n`
- The relationship `sn == i-1` is preserved because both variables are incremented by the same amount
- `n` remains unchanged

## Termination Analysis

When the loop terminates:
- If `n >= 1`: `i` equals `n+1` and `sn` equals `n`
- If `n < 1`: The loop never executes, so `i == 1` and `sn == 0`

The invariants still hold because:
- The relationship between `i` and `sn` is maintained
- The bounds on `i` and `sn` are respected

## Correctness of the Post-condition

The post-condition `(sn != n) ==> (sn == 0)` is satisfied because:
- If `n >= 1`: After the loop, `sn == n`, so the antecedent `sn != n` is false, making the implication true
- If `n < 1`: `sn == 0`, so the consequent is true, making the implication true

## Implication of the Pre-condition

The pre-condition `(sn == 0) * (i == 1) * (n == \at(n, Pre))` directly implies the invariants because:
- It exactly matches the left side of the OR condition in the first two invariants
- For the third invariant, it guarantees that when `n < 1`, the variables maintain their initial values
- The fourth invariant about `n` remaining constant is explicitly part of the pre-condition
