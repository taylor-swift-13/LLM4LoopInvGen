<think>Alright, let's analyze this C program with a loop and identify appropriate loop invariants to help Frama-C verify the program's correctness.

First, let me understand what this program does:

1. It initializes `i = 1` and `sn = 0`.
2. Then it runs a loop while `i <= 8`.
3. In each iteration, it increments both `i` and `sn` by 1.
4. After the loop, there's an assertion that if `sn != 8` then `sn == 0`.

Let's analyze how the variables evolve in the loop:

- Initial values: `i = 1`, `sn = 0`
- After 1st iteration: `i = 2`, `sn = 1`
- After 2nd iteration: `i = 3`, `sn = 2`
- ...
- After 8th iteration: `i = 9`, `sn = 8`

At this point, `i > 8`, so the loop terminates. The final values are `i = 9` and `sn = 8`.

Now I need to fill in two placeholders:
1. `PLACE_HOLDER_i` - a property about `i`
2. `PLACE_HOLDER_sn` - a property about `sn`

For proper loop invariants, I need to ensure they are:
1. True before the loop begins
2. Preserved by each iteration
3. Useful for proving the post-condition

Let's think about the relationships between `i` and `sn`:

From the execution trace, I can see that:
- If the loop has executed at all (i.e., if we're not in the initial state where `sn == 0` and `i == 1`), then `sn = i - 1`
- The values of `i` are bounded: `1 <= i <= 9` (when the loop terminates, `i` becomes 9)
- The values of `sn` are bounded: `0 <= sn <= 8`

So, here are the expressions to fill in:

1. `PLACE_HOLDER_i` should capture the bounds and relationship with `sn`:
   - `(1 <= i <= 9) && (i == sn + 1)`

2. `PLACE_HOLDER_sn` should capture the bounds and relationship with `i`:
   - `(0 <= sn <= 8) && (sn == i - 1)`

However, I notice that these are redundant because they express the same relationship from different perspectives. Let me adjust:

1. `PLACE_HOLDER_i` could focus on the bounds of `i`:
   - `(1 <= i <= 9)`

2. `PLACE_HOLDER_sn` could focus on the relationship between `sn` and `i`:
   - `(sn == i - 1)`

Let's check if these invariants satisfy the requirements:

1. Establishment (initial state before loop):
   - `i = 1` and `sn = 0`: Yes, `sn == i - 1` holds (0 == 1-1)
   - `1 <= i <= 9`: Yes, `i = 1` satisfies this

2. Preservation (after each iteration):
   - `i` becomes `i + 1`
   - `sn` becomes `sn + 1`
   - So if `sn == i - 1` before, then `sn + 1 == (i + 1) - 1` which simplifies to `sn + 1 == i`, which holds
   - The bounds `1 <= i <= 9` are preserved as `i` increases by 1 each time and starts at 1

3. Termination (when loop exits):
   - When `i > 8`, i.e., `i = 9` (because we increment by 1)
   - At this point, `sn = 8` (based on the relationship `sn == i - 1`)
   - So the invariant still holds

4. Helps prove post-condition:
   - Post-condition is: `(sn != 8) ==> (sn == 0)`
   - When the loop terminates, `i = 9` and `sn = 8`
   - If `sn != 8`, then we haven't executed the loop at all (since `sn` would be 8 after the loop), which means `sn` is still 0.
   - So the invariant, combined with the negation of the loop condition, does lead to the post-condition.

With these invariants, the post-condition can be proven.

Let me ensure my syntax matches ACSL requirements for Frama-C:

1. `PLACE_HOLDER_i` = `(1 <= i <= 9)`
2. `PLACE_HOLDER_sn` = `(sn == i - 1)`

But I need to double-check the ACSL syntax. It seems like my formulation might not be correct ACSL syntax. Let me revise:

For the ranges:
- Instead of `1 <= i <= 9`, we should use `(1 <= i) && (i <= 9)`

So the invariants would be:
1. `PLACE_HOLDER_i` = `(1 <= i) && (i <= 9)`
2. `PLACE_HOLDER_sn` = `(sn == i - 1)`

But actually, I think we need to be careful with the original invariant structure. The original has:

```
loop invariant  ((sn == 0)&&(i == 1)) || (PLACE_HOLDER_i) ;
loop invariant  ((sn == 0)&&(i == 1)) || (PLACE_HOLDER_sn) ;
```

So the intended structure is "either we're at the initial state, OR these other conditions hold." This makes sense since we want to cover both the initial state and all subsequent states.

Given this, I think the placeholders should be:

1. `PLACE_HOLDER_i` = `((1 < i) && (i <= 9))`
2. `PLACE_HOLDER_sn` = `(sn == i - 1)`

The reason for `1 < i` instead of `1 <= i` is that the first part of the OR already covers the case when `i == 1`.

Let me reconsider the invariants to ensure they're correct and in the right format:

1. `PLACE_HOLDER_i` = `((1 < i) && (i <= 9))`
2. `PLACE_HOLDER_sn` = `(sn == i - 1)`

These should satisfy the requirements and fit into the given structure.</think>

# Loop Invariant Analysis for the Given C Program

## 1. Analysis

### a. Purpose and Structure of the Loop

The purpose of this loop is to increment both `i` and `sn` by 1 in each iteration, starting from `i=1` and `sn=0`, until `i` exceeds 8.

The loop structure:
- Initialization: `i = 1`, `sn = 0`
- Loop condition: `i <= 8`
- Loop body: Increment both `i` and `sn` by 1
- Relevant variables: `i` and `sn`

### b. Discussion of the Loop Invariant

The proposed loop invariants are:
1. `((sn == 0)&&(i == 1)) || ((1 < i) && (i <= 9))`
2. `((sn == 0)&&(i == 1)) || (sn == i - 1)`

These invariants capture two possible states:
- Either we're at the initial state where `sn=0` and `i=1`
- Or we've executed at least one iteration, in which case `i` is between 2 and 9, and `sn` equals `i-1`

### c. Establishment

Before the loop begins, `sn=0` and `i=1`, so the first part of both invariants (`(sn == 0)&&(i == 1)`) is true. Therefore, the invariants are established before entering the loop.

### d. Preservation

Assume the invariants hold at the start of an iteration:
- If we're in the initial state (`sn=0` and `i=1`), after one iteration `i=2` and `sn=1`. Now the second part of both invariants becomes true: `i` is between 2 and 9, and `sn=i-1`.
- If we're already past the initial state, incrementing both `i` and `sn` by 1 preserves the relationship `sn=i-1`. Also, as long as the loop condition holds, `i` will remain within bounds.

### e. Termination Analysis

The loop terminates when `i > 8`. Given that `i` is incremented by 1 each time and starts at 1, the loop will execute exactly 8 times, resulting in final values of `i=9` and `sn=8`.

At termination:
- The first invariant remains true because `i=9`, which satisfies `(1 < i) && (i <= 9)`
- The second invariant remains true because `sn=8`, which satisfies `sn == i-1` (8 = 9-1)

### f. Correctness of the Post-condition

The post-condition is: `(sn != 8) ==> (sn == 0)`

When the loop terminates, `sn=8`. If `sn != 8`, it means the loop didn't execute at all (or wasn't executed fully, which isn't possible given the loop's structure). If the loop didn't execute, then `sn` remains at its initial value of 0, satisfying the post-condition.

### g. Implication of the Pre-condition

The pre-condition `(sn == 0) * (i == 1)` directly establishes the first part of both loop invariants. Since the loop hasn't started yet, we're guaranteed to be in the initial state described by the pre-condition, which is exactly what the first part of the invariants captures.
