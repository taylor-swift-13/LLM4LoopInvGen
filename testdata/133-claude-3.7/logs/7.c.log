<think>Let me analyze this C program with a loop and identify the appropriate loop invariants to verify the post-condition using Frama-C.

First, let's understand the program:
- We have a function `foo` that takes two integer parameters `x` and `y`.
- There's a precondition: `x >= 0 && x <= 10 && y <= 10 && y >= 0`
- Inside the function, there's a loop with an unknown condition (controlled by `unknown()`).
- In each iteration of the loop, we add 10 to both `x` and `y`.
- After the loop, there's an assertion: `(x == 20) ==> (y != 0)`, which means "if x equals 20, then y must not be 0".

I need to fill in two placeholders for loop invariants:
1. `PLACE_HOLDER_x` - This should be a condition on `x`.
2. `PLACE_HOLDER_y` - This should be a condition on `y`.

The loop invariants are currently structured as:
```
loop invariant (\at(x, Pre) >= 0 && \at(x, Pre) <= 10 && \at(y, Pre) <= 10 && \at(y, Pre) >= 0) ==> (((y == \at(y, Pre))&&(x == \at(x, Pre))) || (PLACE_HOLDER_x));
loop invariant (\at(x, Pre) >= 0 && \at(x, Pre) <= 10 && \at(y, Pre) <= 10 && \at(y, Pre) >= 0) ==> (((y == \at(y, Pre))&&(x == \at(x, Pre))) || (PLACE_HOLDER_y));
```

This structure states that if the pre-conditions hold, then either:
1. `x` and `y` haven't changed (they're still at their initial values), OR
2. Some condition related to `x` is true (for the first invariant) or some condition related to `y` is true (for the second invariant).

To understand what these conditions should be, let's analyze how `x` and `y` change in the loop:
- In each iteration, both `x` and `y` increase by 10.
- After n iterations, `x` would be `x_initial + 10*n` and `y` would be `y_initial + 10*n`.

Now, let's think about what conditions would make the post-condition `(x == 20) ==> (y != 0)` hold:
- If `x` becomes 20, then `y` must not be 0.
- If `x` is initially 10 (within the range 0-10), and after 1 iteration, it becomes 20, then `y` must not become 0 after 1 iteration.
- If `y` is initially 0 (within the range 0-10), then after 1 iteration, it becomes 10, which is not 0, so the post-condition holds.

Given these observations, the loop invariants should capture relationships between `x` and `y` that ensure the post-condition.

For `PLACE_HOLDER_x`, we should express how `x` changes:
If the loop has executed n times, then `x` equals `\at(x, Pre) + 10*n`.
This can be written as: `(x - \at(x, Pre)) % 10 == 0 && x >= \at(x, Pre)`.

For `PLACE_HOLDER_y`, we should express how `y` changes and ensure that if `x` becomes 20, then `y` is not 0:
If the loop has executed n times, then `y` equals `\at(y, Pre) + 10*n`.
This can be written as: `(y - \at(y, Pre)) % 10 == 0 && y >= \at(y, Pre) && (x == 20 ==> y != 0)`.

However, I noticed that there's a direct relationship between the changes in `x` and `y`. Specifically, if `x` increases by 10*n, then `y` also increases by 10*n. So, another invariant could be: `x - \at(x, Pre) == y - \at(y, Pre)`.

Let's combine these insights to fill in the placeholders:

For `PLACE_HOLDER_x`: `(x - \at(x, Pre)) % 10 == 0 && x >= \at(x, Pre) && x - \at(x, Pre) == y - \at(y, Pre)`

For `PLACE_HOLDER_y`: `(y - \at(y, Pre)) % 10 == 0 && y >= \at(y, Pre) && (x == 20 ==> y != 0)`

Let's check if these invariants satisfy the conditions:

1. Establishment: Before the loop, `x == \at(x, Pre)` and `y == \at(y, Pre)`, so both invariants are trivially true.
2. Preservation: If the invariants hold at the start of an iteration and we add 10 to both `x` and `y`, the invariants will still hold at the end of the iteration.
3. Termination: The loop terminates based on the unknown condition. When it does, the invariants should still hold, and combined with the loop's termination condition, they should imply the post-condition.

I think these loop invariants are reasonable, but let's refine them to make sure they're sufficient for proving the post-condition.

The post-condition is: `(x == 20) ==> (y != 0)`.

Let's think about why this would hold given our invariants:
- If `x` becomes 20 (after some iterations), then given our invariant `x - \at(x, Pre) == y - \at(y, Pre)`, we know `y` has increased by the same amount as `x`.
- If `x` started at 10 (the maximum value from the precondition) and became 20 after 1 iteration, then `y` would increase by 10 from its initial value. If `y` started at 0, it would become 10, which is not 0.
- If `x` started at 0 and became 20 after 2 iterations, then `y` would increase by 20 from its initial value. Even if `y` started at 0, it would become 20, which is not 0.

So, based on the invariants and the pre-conditions, the post-condition should hold.

Let's finalize our invariants:

For `PLACE_HOLDER_x`: `(x - \at(x, Pre)) % 10 == 0 && x >= \at(x, Pre) && x - \at(x, Pre) == y - \at(y, Pre)`

For `PLACE_HOLDER_y`: `(y - \at(y, Pre)) % 10 == 0 && y >= \at(y, Pre) && (x == 20 ==> y != 0)`

I believe these are sufficient to prove the post-condition in Frama-C.</think>

# C Program Loop Invariant Analysis

## Purpose and Structure of the Loop

The program's `foo` function takes two integer parameters `x` and `y` with preconditions restricting both to be between 0 and 10 inclusive. Inside the function is a loop with an unknown termination condition (`unknown()`), meaning it could run for any number of iterations. In each iteration, both `x` and `y` are incremented by 10. After the loop, the code verifies that if `x` equals 20, then `y` must not be 0.

## Discussion of the Loop Invariant

I've identified the following invariants:

1. For `x`: `(x - \at(x, Pre)) % 10 == 0 && x >= \at(x, Pre) && x - \at(x, Pre) == y - \at(y, Pre)`
2. For `y`: `(y - \at(y, Pre)) % 10 == 0 && y >= \at(y, Pre) && (x == 20 ==> y != 0)`

These invariants capture several crucial properties:
- Both `x` and `y` increase by multiples of 10
- Both variables never decrease from their initial values
- `x` and `y` always increase by the same amount
- A conditional property ensuring that if `x` is 20, then `y` cannot be 0

## Establishment

Before the loop executes:
- `x` equals `\at(x, Pre)` and `y` equals `\at(y, Pre)`
- The first part of each invariant is satisfied by the initial equality: `(x - \at(x, Pre)) % 10 == 0` because 0 % 10 == 0
- `x >= \at(x, Pre)` and `y >= \at(y, Pre)` are satisfied by equality
- `x - \at(x, Pre) == y - \at(y, Pre)` is satisfied because both equal 0
- If `x` starts at 20 (which is impossible given the precondition `x <= 10`), the implication `(x == 20 ==> y != 0)` is trivially true when false premises are involved

## Preservation

After each iteration:
- Both `x` and `y` increase by exactly 10
- The property `(x - \at(x, Pre)) % 10 == 0` remains true because adding 10 preserves divisibility by 10
- Both variables only increase, so `x >= \at(x, Pre)` and `y >= \at(y, Pre)` continue to hold
- Since both increase by the same amount, `x - \at(x, Pre) == y - \at(y, Pre)` is preserved
- The implication `(x == 20 ==> y != 0)` remains true because:
  - If `x` becomes 20 after some iterations, then `y` has increased by the same amount, so `y` equals `\at(y, Pre) + (20 - \at(x, Pre))`
  - Since `\at(x, Pre) <= 10`, we know `y` has increased by at least 10, meaning `y >= \at(y, Pre) + 10`
  - Since `\at(y, Pre) >= 0`, we have `y >= 10`, ensuring `y != 0`

## Termination Analysis

When the loop terminates (after any number of iterations):
- Both `x` and `y` have increased by the same amount: a multiple of 10
- If the loop executed n times, then `x = \at(x, Pre) + 10*n` and `y = \at(y, Pre) + 10*n`
- All invariant properties continue to hold at termination

## Correctness of the Post-condition

The post-condition `(x == 20) ==> (y != 0)` is guaranteed by:
- If `x` becomes 20, it means we've added exactly `20 - \at(x, Pre)` to the initial value
- Due to our invariant `x - \at(x, Pre) == y - \at(y, Pre)`, we've added the same amount to `y`
- Since `\at(x, Pre) <= 10`, we must have added at least 10 to `x` to reach 20
- Therefore, we've added at least 10 to `y` as well
- With `\at(y, Pre) >= 0`, the final value of `y` is at least 10, ensuring `y != 0`

## Implication of the Pre-condition

The pre-condition `\at(x, Pre) >= 0 && \at(x, Pre) <= 10 && \at(y, Pre) <= 10 && \at(y, Pre) >= 0` directly implies our loop invariant because:
- Initial values satisfy the invariant as discussed in the Establishment section
- The bounds on the initial values ensure that if `x` ever equals 20, `y` will be non-zero
- The initial equality `(y == \at(y, Pre))&&(x == \at(x, Pre))` in the first iteration validates our invariant structure
