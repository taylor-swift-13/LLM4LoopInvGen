<think>I need to analyze this C program and fill in the loop invariants in the ACSL annotations. Let me break down the program first:

The program has two variables:
1. `i` - starts at 1
2. `sn` - starts at 0

The loop increments both `i` and `sn` by 1 in each iteration, while the loop runs as long as `i <= 8`.

Pre-condition: `(sn == 0) * (i == 1)` (note: here * is logical AND in ACSL)
Post-condition: `(sn != 0) ==> (sn == 8)` (if sn is not 0, then sn must equal 8)

The loop invariants to fill in are:
1. `((sn == 0)&&(i == 1)) || (PLACE_HOLDER_i)`
2. `((sn == 0)&&(i == 1)) || (PLACE_HOLDER_sn)`

Now I need to figure out what these placeholders should be.

Since both `i` and `sn` increase by 1 in each iteration, and they start at `i = 1` and `sn = 0`, they will always have the relationship: `sn = i - 1`.

For the first loop invariant (PLACE_HOLDER_i):
- The invariant needs to capture the range of `i` during execution
- `i` starts at 1 and goes up to 9 (since it becomes 9 when the loop terminates)
- So a good invariant for `i` would be `1 <= i <= 9`

For the second loop invariant (PLACE_HOLDER_sn):
- The invariant needs to capture the relationship between `sn` and `i`
- Since `sn = i - 1` throughout the execution, we can say `sn == i - 1`
- We also know that `sn` will range from 0 to 8
- So we could use `0 <= sn <= 8 && sn == i - 1`

But looking at the structure, the invariant already includes `((sn == 0)&&(i == 1)) ||`, which covers the initial state. So our placeholders need to cover the states after the first iteration.

For PLACE_HOLDER_i, I'll use: `(2 <= i <= 9)`
For PLACE_HOLDER_sn, I'll use: `(sn == i - 1 && 1 <= sn <= 8)`

Let me verify these invariants:

1. Establishment:
   - Initially `i = 1` and `sn = 0`, so the first part of the invariant `((sn == 0)&&(i == 1))` is true.

2. Preservation:
   - If `i > 1`, then after one iteration, `i` increases by 1 and `sn` increases by 1.
   - The relationship `sn == i - 1` is preserved.
   - The bounds `2 <= i <= 9` and `1 <= sn <= 8` are maintained.

3. Termination:
   - The loop terminates when `i > 8`, which means `i = 9` and `sn = 8`.
   - At termination, the invariant still holds: `sn == i - 1 = 9 - 1 = 8`.

4. Post-condition:
   - The post-condition is `(sn != 0) ==> (sn == 8)`
   - When the loop terminates, `sn = 8`, so if `sn != 0`, then indeed `sn = 8`.

These invariants look good and should be sufficient to prove the post-condition.</think>

# Loop Invariant Analysis for C Program

## Analysis of the Given C Program

### A. Purpose and Structure of the Loop

The purpose of this loop is to increment two variables, `i` and `sn`, exactly 8 times. The loop starts with `i = 1` and `sn = 0` and increments both by 1 in each iteration until `i` exceeds 8.

The loop structure:
- Loop condition: `i <= 8`
- Loop body: Increments both `i` and `sn` by 1
- Relevant variables: `i` (starts at 1) and `sn` (starts at 0)

### B. Discussion of the Loop Invariant

The proposed loop invariants are:
1. `((sn == 0)&&(i == 1)) || (2 <= i <= 9)`
2. `((sn == 0)&&(i == 1)) || (sn == i - 1 && 1 <= sn <= 8)`

These invariants capture two key aspects:
- The initial state where `sn = 0` and `i = 1`
- The relationship between `sn` and `i` during execution (`sn = i - 1`)
- The valid ranges for both variables

### C. Establishment

The invariants are established before the loop starts:
- Initially, `sn = 0` and `i = 1`, so the first part `((sn == 0)&&(i == 1))` is true
- Since this first part is true, both invariants as a whole are true before the loop begins

### D. Preservation

If the invariants hold at the start of an iteration:
- If we're in the initial state (`sn = 0, i = 1`), after one iteration `i = 2` and `sn = 1`. Now the second part of each invariant becomes true: `2 <= i <= 9` and `sn == i - 1 && 1 <= sn <= 8`.
- For subsequent iterations, both `i` and `sn` increase by 1, maintaining the relationship `sn = i - 1`.
- As long as `i <= 8` (the loop condition), the values of `i` will remain within `2 <= i <= 9` and `sn` will remain within `1 <= sn <= 8`.

### E. Termination Analysis

The loop terminates when `i > 8`, which occurs after 8 iterations. At this point:
- `i = 9` (started at 1, incremented 8 times)
- `sn = 8` (started at 0, incremented 8 times)
- The invariant still holds: `2 <= i <= 9` is true and `sn == i - 1 && 1 <= sn <= 8` is true

### F. Correctness of the Post-condition

The post-condition is `(sn != 0) ==> (sn == 8)`, which means "if sn is not 0, then sn must equal 8."

When the loop terminates:
- `sn = 8` (which is not 0)
- The post-condition becomes `(8 != 0) ==> (8 == 8)`, which is true

The loop invariant guarantees that if the loop runs any iterations at all, `sn` will exactly equal 8 when the loop terminates, thus ensuring the post-condition.

### G. Implication of the Pre-condition

The pre-condition `(sn == 0) * (i == 1)` (where * represents logical AND) directly implies the loop invariant.

The pre-condition states exactly that `sn = 0` and `i = 1` before the loop begins, which matches the first part of our invariant `((sn == 0)&&(i == 1))`. Since this part is true before the loop starts, the entire invariant is established.
