<think>Let me analyze this C program with a loop and identify the appropriate loop invariants to replace the placeholders.

First, let's understand what the program does:

1. We start with x = 1 and y = some value passed to the function
2. In the loop, as long as x <= 100:
   - y is set to 100 - x
   - x is incremented by 1
3. After the loop, we need to prove that y >= 0

Pre-condition: `(x == 1) * (y == \at(y, Pre))`
This states that initially x is 1 and y equals the value of y at the precondition (the parameter value).

Post-condition: `y >= 0`
We need to prove that y is non-negative after the loop.

Now, let's think about the loop invariants needed to replace PLACE_HOLDER_y and PLACE_HOLDER_x.

In the loop:
- x starts at 1 and gets incremented by 1 each iteration
- y is set to 100 - x in each iteration

Since we need to prove y >= 0 after the loop, and y = 100 - x, we need to know the final value of x to determine y. The loop terminates when x > 100, so the final value of x will be 101, making y = 100 - 101 = -1. But that would make y negative, which contradicts our post-condition!

Let me think more carefully. After each iteration:
- x increases by 1
- y equals 100 - x

So at the end of the loop, when x becomes 101, y will be 100 - 101 = -1.

But let's analyze the problem again. The loop condition is x <= 100, so the loop continues as long as x is less than or equal to 100. When x becomes 101, the loop terminates. At that point, y will be 100 - 100 = 0 (from the last iteration where x = 100).

So after the loop, y = 0, which satisfies the post-condition y >= 0.

For the loop invariants, we need to capture the relationship between x and y during the loop execution. The invariants need to be true before the loop, maintained by each iteration, and when combined with the loop exit condition should imply the post-condition.

Let's fill in PLACE_HOLDER_y and PLACE_HOLDER_x:

For PLACE_HOLDER_y, we want to express what happens to y during the loop. After the first iteration, y becomes 100 - x, so we should capture that.

For PLACE_HOLDER_x, we want to express the bounds of x during the loop. We know that x starts at 1 and increases by 1 each iteration until it exceeds 100.

So our invariants should be:
1. PLACE_HOLDER_y: (y == 100 - x + 1)
2. PLACE_HOLDER_x: (x >= 2 && x <= 101)

Let's see:
- Before the loop, the first part of the invariant is true (x==1 && y==\at(y, Pre))
- After the first iteration, x=2 and y=100-1=99, so the second part becomes true (y==100-x+1 and x>=2 && x<=101)
- At the end of the loop, x=101 and y=0, which satisfies the post-condition y>=0

But I need to think more carefully about the exact form of the invariants.

Wait, there's a logical error in my thinking. The assignment y = 100 - x happens at the beginning of each iteration. So after the first iteration, when x = 2, y will be 100 - 2 = 98, not 99.

Let me re-think this:
- Before the loop (x=1), the first part of the invariant is true
- After each iteration, y = 100 - x and x = x + 1
- So at the end of each iteration, y = 100 - (x-1) = 101 - x
- When the loop terminates, x = 101, so y = 101 - 101 = 0

So the invariants should be:
1. PLACE_HOLDER_y: (y == 101 - x)
2. PLACE_HOLDER_x: (x >= 2 && x <= 101)

Let me check again:
- When x=1 (before the loop), the first part is true
- When x=2 (after first iteration), y=99, so y=101-2 is true
- When x=101 (loop termination), y=0, so y=101-101 is true, and this implies y>=0

But there's another issue. In the given template, the invariants are joined with "||" (OR), not "&&" (AND). This suggests that either the first part OR the second part should be true at any point.

Let me rethink this once more:
- Before the loop: (x == 1 && y == \at(y, Pre)) is true, and the second part can be false
- During/after the loop: The first part becomes false (because x is no longer 1), so the second part must be true

The invariant template seems to be structured to have two cases:
1. Before the loop starts
2. During/after the loop execution

So for PLACE_HOLDER_y, we need an expression that's true during/after the loop and relates y to the current x value. Since y = 100 - x in each iteration, this seems like the natural choice.

For PLACE_HOLDER_x, we need an expression that's true during/after the loop and bounds x. Since x starts at 1, gets incremented by 1 each iteration, and stops when x > 100, the bounds should be 2 <= x <= 101.

So the filled placeholders should be:
1. PLACE_HOLDER_y: (y == 100 - (x-1))
2. PLACE_HOLDER_x: (x >= 2 && x <= 101)

Let me check this once more:
- Before the loop: The first part (x==1 && y==\at(y, Pre)) is true
- After first iteration: x=2, y=99, so y=100-(2-1) is true
- At loop termination: x=101, y=0, so y=100-(101-1) is true, and this implies y>=0

Actually, let me simplify PLACE_HOLDER_y:
100 - (x-1) = 100 - x + 1 = 101 - x

So:
1. PLACE_HOLDER_y: (y == 101 - x)
2. PLACE_HOLDER_x: (x >= 2 && x <= 101)

This looks correct to me. Let me review the full invariants:

```
loop invariant ((x == 1)&&(y == \at(y, Pre))) || (y == 101 - x);
loop invariant ((x == 1)&&(y == \at(y, Pre))) || (x >= 2 && x <= 101);
```

These capture the state of the program before the loop (first part) and during/after the loop (second part). They are maintained by each iteration and, when combined with the loop exit condition, imply the post-condition y >= 0.</think>

# Analysis of Loop Invariants for the Given C Program

## A. Purpose and Structure of the Loop

This program's loop serves to calculate a value for `y` based on the final value of `x` after iteration. Specifically:

- The loop initializes with `x = 1` and the original value of `y` (from the parameter).
- In each iteration, `y` is updated to `100 - x`, and `x` is incremented by 1.
- The loop continues as long as `x ≤ 100`.
- The goal is to ensure that `y ≥ 0` after the loop terminates.

## B. Discussion of the Loop Invariant

The loop invariants capture two cases:
1. Before the loop starts: `x = 1` and `y` equals its original parameter value
2. During and after the loop: `y = 101 - x` and `2 ≤ x ≤ 101`

These invariants are valid because they accurately describe the relationship between variables throughout the loop's execution.

## C. Establishment

Before the loop begins, `x = 1` and `y` equals its original value from the pre-condition. The first part of both invariants (`(x == 1)&&(y == \at(y, Pre))`) is therefore true.

## D. Preservation

Let's consider an arbitrary iteration where the invariants are true:
- If we're in the first iteration, `x = 1` changes to `x = 2` and `y` becomes `100 - 1 = 99`
- For any iteration, after executing `y = 100 - x` and `x = x + 1`, we have:
  - `y = 100 - (x-1) = 101 - x` (our first key invariant)
  - `x` increases by 1, maintaining `2 ≤ x ≤ 101` as long as the loop condition is true

## E. Termination Analysis

The loop terminates when `x > 100`, which means `x = 101` (as x increases by 1 in each iteration). At this point:
- `y = 101 - 101 = 0` (based on our invariant)
- `x = 101`, which satisfies `2 ≤ x ≤ 101`

## F. Correctness of the Post-condition

When the loop terminates, `x = 101` and our invariant guarantees that `y = 101 - x = 0`. This ensures that `y ≥ 0`, satisfying the post-condition. The invariant, combined with the loop termination condition (`x > 100`), directly implies that `y = 0`.

## G. Implication of the Pre-condition

The pre-condition `(x == 1) * (y == \at(y, Pre))` directly implies the loop invariant before the loop begins, as the first part of our invariants exactly matches this condition.
