<think>Let's analyze this C program carefully to determine the appropriate loop invariants. 

First, let's understand what the program is doing:

```c
void foo(int n) {
    int i = 1;
    int sn = 0;
    
    while (i <= n) {
        i = (i + 1);
        sn = (sn + 1);
    }
    
    /*@ assert (sn!= 0) ==> (sn ==n); */
}
```

The program initializes `i = 1` and `sn = 0`, then enters a loop that increments both `i` and `sn` by 1 in each iteration until `i > n`. After the loop, the post-condition asserts that if `sn` is not 0, then `sn` equals `n`.

I need to fill in two placeholders:
- `PLACE_HOLDER_i` - a condition involving `i`
- `PLACE_HOLDER_sn` - a condition involving `sn`

Let's trace through the loop execution to understand the behavior:

- Before the loop: `i = 1`, `sn = 0`
- After 1st iteration: `i = 2`, `sn = 1`
- After 2nd iteration: `i = 3`, `sn = 2`
- ...
- After `n-1` iterations: `i = n`, `sn = n-1`
- After `n` iterations: `i = n+1`, `sn = n`

When the loop terminates, `i = n+1` and `sn = n` (assuming `n ≥ 1`).

Now, let's reason about the loop invariants:

1. For `PLACE_HOLDER_i`, we need a condition that relates `i` to the other variables. Since `i` starts at 1 and increases by 1 each iteration, a reasonable invariant would be `(1 <= i <= n+1)`.

2. For `PLACE_HOLDER_sn`, we need a condition that relates `sn` to the other variables. Since `sn` starts at 0 and increases by 1 each iteration, and `i` is always one more than `sn` after initialization, a reasonable invariant would be `(sn == i-1)`.

Let's check if these invariants satisfy the conditions:

**Establishment**:
- Before the loop: `i = 1`, `sn = 0`
- `1 <= i <= n+1`: `1 <= 1 <= n+1` is true (assuming `n >= 1`)
- `sn == i-1`: `0 == 1-1` is true

**Preservation**:
- If the invariants hold at the start of an iteration and the loop condition is true:
  - `i <= n` (loop condition)
  - `1 <= i <= n+1` and `sn == i-1` (invariants)
  - After executing the loop body: `i = i+1` and `sn = sn+1`
  - New invariant check: `1 <= i+1 <= n+1` (still true since `i <= n`) and `sn+1 == (i+1)-1` which simplifies to `sn+1 == i` which is true

**Termination**:
- When the loop terminates, the loop condition is false: `i > n`
- From our invariant, we know `i <= n+1`, so `i = n+1`
- Also, `sn == i-1`, so `sn == n`

This means when the loop terminates, `sn = n`, which is exactly what we need to prove the post-condition `(sn!= 0) ==> (sn ==n)`.

Let's check the post-condition:
- If `n >= 1`, then the loop executes at least once, and `sn` becomes at least 1, so `sn != 0` and `sn = n`.
- If `n < 1`, then the loop doesn't execute at all, and `sn` remains 0.

The post-condition `(sn!= 0) ==> (sn ==n)` is satisfied in both cases.

Now, let's fill in the placeholders:

For `PLACE_HOLDER_i`: `(1 <= i <= n+1)`
For `PLACE_HOLDER_sn`: `(sn == i-1)`

But looking at the structure of the loop invariants again:

```
loop invariant (1 <= \at(n, Pre)) ==> (((sn == 0)&&(i == 1)&&(n == \at(n, Pre))) || (PLACE_HOLDER_i));
loop invariant (1 <= \at(n, Pre)) ==> (((sn == 0)&&(i == 1)&&(n == \at(n, Pre))) || (PLACE_HOLDER_sn));
```

The invariants use an implication and a disjunction. If `n >= 1`, then either the initial condition holds `((sn == 0)&&(i == 1)&&(n == \at(n, Pre)))` or our placeholder holds.

Since the initial conditions represent the state before the loop, and our placeholders need to capture the state during and after the loop, I'll refine them:

For `PLACE_HOLDER_i`: `((1 < i <= n+1) && (n == \at(n, Pre)))`
For `PLACE_HOLDER_sn`: `((0 < sn <= n) && (sn == i-1) && (n == \at(n, Pre)))`

These invariants capture the fact that:
1. `i` increases from 1 to `n+1`
2. `sn` increases from 0 to `n`
3. `sn` is always equal to `i-1`
4. `n` remains unchanged</think>

# Loop Invariant Analysis for Program

## a. Purpose and Structure of the Loop

The loop in this program is designed to compute a sum by incrementing a counter `sn` exactly `n` times. The loop iterates from `i=1` to `i=n`, incrementing both `i` and `sn` by 1 in each iteration.

**Key components:**
- Loop condition: `i <= n`
- Variables: `i` (counter), `sn` (sum), `n` (input parameter)
- Loop body: Increments both `i` and `sn` by 1

At the end, if `n ≥ 1`, then `sn` will equal `n`. If `n < 1`, the loop doesn't execute and `sn` remains 0.

## b. Discussion of the Loop Invariant

The loop invariant consists of several conditions that capture the relationship between variables throughout execution:

1. When `n ≥ 1`, either:
   - We're at the initial state (`sn == 0`, `i == 1`), OR
   - `i` has advanced within a valid range and `sn` maintains its relationship with `i`

2. When `n < 1`, the program stays in its initial state, as the loop doesn't execute

3. The value of `n` never changes during execution

These invariants fully characterize the program state at any point during execution.

## c. Establishment

Before the loop execution begins:
- `sn = 0`
- `i = 1`
- `n` is the input value

The pre-condition specifies exactly this state: `(sn == 0) * (i == 1) * (n == \at(n, Pre))`. 

This initial state satisfies our invariants because:
- If `n ≥ 1`, the first disjunctive clause in each invariant is true
- If `n < 1`, the entire invariant reduces to the initial state

## d. Preservation

Let's assume the invariants hold at the start of an iteration and the loop condition `i <= n` is true.

After executing the loop body:
- `i` increases by 1
- `sn` increases by 1

This preserves our invariants because:
- `i` remains in its bound (now between 2 and n+1)
- `sn` also increases proportionally (between 1 and n)
- The relationship `sn == i-1` is maintained
- `n` remains unchanged

## e. Termination Analysis

When the loop terminates, `i > n`. Given our invariant that `i ≤ n+1`, we can determine that `i = n+1` when the loop terminates.

From our other invariant `sn == i-1`, we have `sn = n` at termination (when `n ≥ 1`).

If `n < 1`, the loop doesn't execute at all, and the program remains in its initial state with `sn = 0`, `i = 1`.

## f. Correctness of the Post-condition

The post-condition is `(sn != 0) ==> (sn == n)`.

When the loop terminates:
- If `n ≥ 1`, then `sn = n` (which is non-zero), satisfying the post-condition
- If `n < 1`, then `sn = 0`, and the implication is trivially true (false antecedent)

Therefore, the post-condition holds in all cases.

## g. Implication of the Pre-condition

The pre-condition `(sn == 0) * (i == 1) * (n == \at(n, Pre))` directly establishes the loop invariant before the loop begins.

- It specifies the exact initial values of variables
- It ensures that the loop invariant is satisfied at the beginning
- It provides the basis for reasoning about how the variables change during execution
