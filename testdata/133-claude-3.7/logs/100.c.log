<think>Let me analyze this C program and identify the appropriate loop invariants to fill in the placeholders.

First, let's understand what the program is doing:

1. It takes an integer parameter `n` (which must be non-negative according to the precondition)
2. It initializes `x = n` and `y = 0`
3. It runs a loop while `x > 0`, where in each iteration:
   - It increments `y` by 1
   - It decrements `x` by 1
4. After the loop, there's an assertion that `y == n`

Now let me analyze what happens in this loop:
- Initially, `x = n` and `y = 0`
- After each iteration, `x` decreases by 1 and `y` increases by 1
- The loop terminates when `x` reaches 0
- At the end, `y` will have been incremented exactly `n` times (since `x` started at `n` and decremented to 0)
- So at the end, `y = n`, which matches the assertion

Let's think about the loop invariants:

The invariants have placeholders:
1. `PLACE_HOLDER_x`
2. `PLACE_HOLDER_y`

Let's understand the structure of the invariants:

```
loop invariant  (\at(n, Pre) >= 0) ==> ((\at(n, Pre) > 0) ==> (((y == 0)&&(x == \at(n, Pre))&&(n == \at(n, Pre))) || (PLACE_HOLDER_x))) ;
```

This says: if the precondition holds and n > 0, then either we're at the initial state OR some condition on x holds.

```
loop invariant  (\at(n, Pre) >= 0) ==> ((\at(n, Pre) > 0) ==> (((y == 0)&&(x == \at(n, Pre))&&(n == \at(n, Pre))) || (PLACE_HOLDER_y))) ;
```

This says: if the precondition holds and n > 0, then either we're at the initial state OR some condition on y holds.

```
loop invariant (\at(n, Pre) >= 0) ==> ((!(\at(n, Pre) > 0)) ==> ((y == 0)&&(x == \at(n, Pre))&&(n == \at(n, Pre))));
```

This handles the case where n = 0. In this case, we stay at the initial state.

```
loop invariant (\at(n, Pre) >= 0) ==> (n == \at(n, Pre));
```

This says n never changes throughout the loop.

I need to determine suitable invariants for `PLACE_HOLDER_x` and `PLACE_HOLDER_y`. A key insight is that the sum of `x` and `y` remains constant throughout the loop, and that constant is `n`. Also, both variables maintain bounds.

For `PLACE_HOLDER_x`, I think a good invariant would be: `((x >= 0) && (x < \at(n, Pre)) && (x + y == \at(n, Pre)))`
- `x` is always non-negative (required for the loop to terminate properly)
- `x` is strictly less than the initial value of `n` (since we've made at least one iteration)
- The sum of `x` and `y` equals the initial value of `n` (this is the key invariant)

For `PLACE_HOLDER_y`, I think a good invariant would be: `((y > 0) && (y <= \at(n, Pre)) && (x + y == \at(n, Pre)))`
- `y` is positive (since we've made at least one iteration)
- `y` is at most the initial value of `n` (it will reach exactly `n` when the loop terminates)
- Again, the sum of `x` and `y` equals the initial value of `n`

Let's verify these invariants:

1. Establishment: Before the loop, `x = n` and `y = 0`, so `x + y = n`, but neither of our proposed invariants hold yet. However, the condition in the disjunction before our placeholders (the initial state condition) does hold, so the overall invariant holds.

2. Preservation: If our invariants hold at the start of an iteration, after executing the loop body:
   - `x` decreases by 1
   - `y` increases by 1
   - Their sum remains constant
   - The bounds on `x` and `y` are maintained
   - So our invariants continue to hold

3. Termination: When the loop terminates, `x = 0` (since the loop condition `x > 0` is now false). From our invariant `x + y = n`, we get `y = n`, which is exactly what we need to prove the post-condition.

These invariants should be sufficient to prove the post-condition.</think>

# Loop Invariant Analysis for the Given C Program

## 1. Analysis

### a. Purpose and Structure of the Loop

The purpose of this loop is to transfer the value of `n` to the variable `y` by decrementing `x` (which is initially equal to `n`) and incrementing `y` (which is initially 0) until `x` reaches 0.

**Structure:**
- Loop condition: `x > 0`
- Body operations:
  - Increment `y` by 1
  - Decrement `x` by 1
- Relevant variables: `x`, `y`, and `n` (constant throughout execution)

### b. Discussion of the Loop Invariant

The key loop invariant is that `x + y == n` throughout the loop's execution. This invariant captures the essence of the program: we're transferring the value of `n` from `x` to `y` one unit at a time.

Additionally, we need invariants about the ranges of `x` and `y`:
- `x` is non-negative and decreases with each iteration
- `y` is non-negative and increases with each iteration

### c. Establishment

Before the loop begins:
- `x = n` (from initialization)
- `y = 0` (from initialization)
- `n` is non-negative (from pre-condition)

This initial state satisfies our invariants:
- `x + y = n + 0 = n` (so `x + y == n` holds)
- `x` is non-negative since `n` is non-negative
- `y` is 0, which is non-negative

### d. Preservation

Assume our invariants hold at the start of an iteration and the loop condition (`x > 0`) is true.

After executing the loop body:
- `y` becomes `y + 1`
- `x` becomes `x - 1`

Let's check our invariants:
- `(x - 1) + (y + 1) = x + y = n` (so `x + y == n` still holds)
- `x - 1` is still non-negative since `x > 0` at the start
- `y + 1` is still positive since `y` was non-negative

### e. Termination Analysis

The loop terminates when `x <= 0`. Since `x` is decremented by 1 each iteration and is initialized to `n`, the loop will execute exactly `n` times if `n > 0`, or 0 times if `n = 0`.

When the loop terminates:
- `x = 0` (since the loop condition `x > 0` is now false and `x` can't be negative)
- `y = n` (from our invariant `x + y = n`, with `x = 0`)
- `n` remains unchanged

### f. Correctness of the Post-condition

The post-condition is `y == n`. When the loop terminates, `x = 0` and our invariant `x + y = n` implies that `y = n`. Therefore, the post-condition is satisfied.

### g. Implication of the Pre-condition

The pre-condition states that `n >= 0` and `(y == 0) * (x == n) * (n == n)`. This directly establishes our invariants at the start:
- `n` is non-negative
- `x = n` and `y = 0` initially
- `x + y = n + 0 = n` initially
