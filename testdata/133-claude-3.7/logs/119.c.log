<think>Let me analyze this C program with a loop and identify the proper loop invariants to replace the placeholders in the ACSL annotations.

First, let's understand what the program is doing:

```c
void foo(int size) {
    int i = 1;
    int sn = 0;
    
    /* Loop with ACSL annotations */
    while (i <= size) {
        i = (i + 1);
        sn = (sn + 1);
    }
    
    /*@ assert (sn != 0) ==> (sn == size);*/
}
```

The program initializes `i` to 1 and `sn` to 0. In each iteration of the loop, both `i` and `sn` are incremented by 1. The loop continues until `i` becomes greater than `size`. After the loop, there's an assertion checking that if `sn` is not 0, then it must equal `size`.

Let's look at the loop invariants we need to replace:

```
loop invariant (1 <= \at(size, Pre)) ==> (((sn == 0)&&(i == 1)&&(size == \at(size, Pre))) || (PLACE_HOLDER_i));
loop invariant (1 <= \at(size, Pre)) ==> (((sn == 0)&&(i == 1)&&(size == \at(size, Pre))) || (PLACE_HOLDER_sn));
loop invariant (!(1 <= \at(size, Pre))) ==> ((sn == 0)&&(i == 1)&&(size == \at(size, Pre)));
loop invariant size == \at(size, Pre);
```

We need to find appropriate expressions for `PLACE_HOLDER_i` and `PLACE_HOLDER_sn` that will help prove the post-condition: `(sn != 0) ==> (sn == size)`.

Let's analyze the loop behavior:
- If `size < 1`, the loop never executes, and we exit with `i = 1` and `sn = 0`.
- If `size >= 1`, the loop executes and both `i` and `sn` increase by 1 in each iteration.
- After the loop, `i` will be `size + 1` and `sn` will be `size`.

So, for our invariants:

For `PLACE_HOLDER_i`, we need an expression that relates `i` to its changes during the loop. Since `i` starts at 1 and gets incremented in each iteration, and we exit when `i > size`, the invariant should capture that `i` is somewhere between its initial value (1) and its final value (size + 1).

For `PLACE_HOLDER_sn`, we need an expression that relates `sn` to its changes during the loop. Since `sn` starts at 0 and gets incremented in each iteration, and will reach `size` by the end, the invariant should capture that `sn` is somewhere between its initial value (0) and its final value (size).

Also, there's a relationship between `i` and `sn`: since both variables are incremented by 1 in each iteration and `i` starts at 1 while `sn` starts at 0, we have `sn = i - 1` throughout the execution.

So for the placeholders:
- `PLACE_HOLDER_i` should represent: `1 < i <= size + 1`
- `PLACE_HOLDER_sn` should represent: `0 < sn <= size` and `sn == i - 1`

Combining these, the invariants would look like:

For `PLACE_HOLDER_i`: `(1 < i <= size + 1) && (i == sn + 1)`
For `PLACE_HOLDER_sn`: `(0 < sn <= size) && (sn == i - 1)`

Let's check if these invariants satisfy the required conditions:

1. Establishment: 
   - Initially, `i = 1` and `sn = 0`, so `i = sn + 1` holds.
   - If `size < 1`, the invariant `!(1 <= \at(size, Pre)) ==> ((sn == 0)&&(i == 1)&&(size == \at(size, Pre)))` holds because we have `sn = 0` and `i = 1`.
   - If `size >= 1`, the invariant `(1 <= \at(size, Pre)) ==> (((sn == 0)&&(i == 1)&&(size == \at(size, Pre))) || ((1 < i <= size + 1) && (i == sn + 1)))` holds because we have `sn = 0` and `i = 1`.

2. Preservation: 
   - In each iteration, both `i` and `sn` are incremented by 1, so the relationship `i = sn + 1` is preserved.
   - Also, as long as `i <= size` (the loop condition), `i` remains within the specified bounds.

3. Termination:
   - The loop terminates when `i > size`, which gives us `i = size + 1` and `sn = size` (using `sn = i - 1`).
   - With these values, our invariants still hold.

4. Post-condition:
   - After the loop, if `size >= 1`, then `sn = size`, which satisfies the post-condition `(sn != 0) ==> (sn == size)`.
   - If `size < 1`, then `sn = 0`, which also satisfies the post-condition because the premise `sn != 0` is false, making the implication true.

Let's finalize the loop invariants:

For `PLACE_HOLDER_i`: `(1 < i <= size + 1) && (i == sn + 1)`
For `PLACE_HOLDER_sn`: `(0 < sn <= size) && (sn == i - 1)`

Actually, let me simplify these to make them clearer:

For `PLACE_HOLDER_i`: `(1 < i <= size + 1) && (i == sn + 1)`
For `PLACE_HOLDER_sn`: `(0 < sn <= size) && (sn == i - 1)`

On second thought, I think I could simplify even further. Given that we have `i == sn + 1`, I can express `sn` in terms of `i` and vice versa. Let's use:

For `PLACE_HOLDER_i`: `(1 < i <= size + 1)`
For `PLACE_HOLDER_sn`: `(sn == i - 1) && (0 < sn <= size)`

Actually, I think we can simplify even further by recognizing that if `sn == i - 1` and `1 < i <= size + 1`, then `0 < sn <= size` is automatically implied. So:

For `PLACE_HOLDER_i`: `(1 < i <= size + 1)`
For `PLACE_HOLDER_sn`: `(sn == i - 1)`

Let's use these as the final replacements for the placeholders.</think>

# Analysis of Loop Invariants for the Given C Program

## Purpose and Structure of the Loop

The purpose of this loop is to increment a counter `sn` a total of `size` times, starting from 0. The loop uses a variable `i` that starts at 1 and increments alongside `sn` until `i` exceeds `size`.

The loop structure consists of:
- Loop condition: `i <= size`
- Operations in the loop body: increment both `i` and `sn` by 1 each iteration
- Relevant variables: `i` (loop counter), `sn` (sum), and `size` (parameter)

## Discussion of the Loop Invariant

For this loop, we need invariants that maintain the relationship between variables throughout execution. The key relationships are:

1. `i` is always one more than `sn` (`i == sn + 1`)
2. `i` starts at 1 and increases, but never exceeds `size + 1`
3. `sn` starts at 0 and increases, but never exceeds `size`

## Analysis of the Invariants

### Establishment
Before the loop begins, `i = 1` and `sn = 0`, which clearly establishes the relationship `i = sn + 1`. If `size < 1`, the loop won't execute at all, and the invariant for that case holds trivially.

### Preservation
During each iteration:
- `i` increases by 1
- `sn` increases by 1
- This maintains the relationship `i = sn + 1` throughout
- The bounds on both variables are preserved as long as `i <= size`

### Termination Analysis
When the loop terminates, `i > size` (first time the condition is false), which means `i = size + 1`. Due to our invariant relationship, this means `sn = i - 1 = size`. This gives us the exact values at termination: `i = size + 1` and `sn = size`.

### Correctness of the Post-condition
The post-condition is `(sn != 0) ==> (sn == size)`. Let's analyze:
- If `size < 1`, the loop never executes, so `sn = 0`. The premise `sn != 0` is false, making the entire implication true.
- If `size >= 1`, the loop executes at least once, resulting in `sn = size`. Since `size >= 1`, we have `sn != 0`, and the implication is true because `sn == size`.

### Implication of the Pre-condition
The pre-condition `(sn == 0) * (i == 1) * (size == \at(size, Pre))` directly establishes our invariant before the loop begins. It sets the initial values that satisfy the relationship `i = sn + 1` and confirms that `size` remains unchanged.
