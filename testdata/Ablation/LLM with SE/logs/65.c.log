    /*@ assert (y >= 0); */

To address the task, let's analyze the given C loop program and fill in the placeholders in the loop invariant with appropriate logical expressions.

### Analysis

**a. Purpose and Structure of the Loop:**
- **Objective:** The loop iterates to increment `x` from its initial value until it exceeds 100, while updating `y` to be `100 - x` in each iteration. The goal is to ensure that after the loop, `y` is non-negative.
- **Structure:**
  - **Loop Condition:** `x <= 100`
  - **Operations:** `y = 100 - x; x = x + 1;`
  - **Relevant Variables:** `x` and `y`

**b. Discussion of the Loop Invariant:**
- The loop invariants are designed to capture the relationships between `x` and `y` throughout the loop execution. They ensure that the properties required to prove the post-condition hold true.

**c. Establishment:**
- Before the loop starts, `x` is initialized to `1`, and `y` is unchanged from its pre-condition value. Thus, the invariants hold as `y == 100 - x` when `x = 1`.

**d. Preservation:**
- If the invariants hold at the beginning of an iteration, and the loop condition `x <= 100` is true, the update operations `y = 100 - x` and `x = x + 1` will maintain these invariants.

**e. Termination Analysis of the Loop:**
- The loop terminates when `x > 100`. At this point, `y = 100 - x` implies that `y >= 0` since `y` reaches `0` when `x` becomes `101`.

**f. Correctness of the Post-condition:**
- After the loop, `x > 100`, which implies `y = 100 - x` is non-negative as the loop invariant holds true throughout, ensuring that `y >= 0` when the loop exits.

**g. Implication of the Pre-condition:**
- The pre-condition ensures that `x` starts at `1` and `y` is at its initial value, making the invariant `y = 100 - x` valid initially.

With this reasoning, we can fill in the placeholders:

```c
void foo(int y) {
    int x = 1;
    
    /* >>> LOOP INVARIANT TO FILL <<< */
    
    /*@
      loop invariant ((x == 1)&&(y == \at(y, Pre))) || (y == 100 - x) ;
      loop invariant ((x == 1)&&(y == \at(y, Pre))) || (x >= 1 && x <= 101) ;
    */
    while (x <= 100) {
        y = 100 - x;
        x = x + 1;
    }
    
    /*@ assert (y >= 0); */
}
```

This completes the task of filling in the placeholders with appropriate loop invariants.

void foo(int y) {
    int x = 1;
    
    /* >>> LOOP INVARIANT TO FILL <<< */
    
    /*@
      loop invariant ((x == 1)&&(y == \at(y, Pre))) || (y == 100 - x) ;
      loop invariant ((x == 1)&&(y == \at(y, Pre))) || (x >= 1 && x <= 101) ;
    */
    while (x <= 100) {
        y = 100 - x;
        x = x + 1;
    }
    
    /*@ assert (y >= 0); */
}


void foo(int y) {
    int x = 1;
    
    /* >>> LOOP INVARIANT TO FILL <<< */
    
    /*@
      loop invariant ((x == 1)&&(y == \at(y, Pre))) || (y == 100 - x) ;
      loop invariant ((x == 1)&&(y == \at(y, Pre))) || (x >= 1 && x <= 101) ;
    */
    while (x <= 100) {
        y = 100 - x;
        x = x + 1;
    }
    
    /*@ assert (y >= 0); */
}

/*@
      loop invariant ((x == 1)&&(y == \at(y, Pre))) || (y == 100 - x) ;
      loop invariant ((x == 1)&&(y == \at(y, Pre))) || (x >= 1 && x <= 101) ;
    */
    while (x <= 100) {
        y = 100 - x;
        x = x + 1;
    }

}
To analyze the given C loop and determine appropriate loop invariants, let's go through the steps methodically.

### a. Purpose and Structure of the Loop:

- **Objective:** The loop incrementally increases the variable `x` from 1 to 101 while adjusting `y` such that `y = 100 - x` after each iteration.
- **Structure:**
  - **Initialization:** `int x = 1;`
  - **Loop Condition:** `x <= 100`
  - **Body Operations:**
    - `y = 100 - x;`
    - `x = x + 1;`
  - **Relevant Variables:** `x` and `y`.

### b. Discussion of the Loop Invariant:

- **Proposed Loop Invariant:**
  - `((x == 1)&&(y == \at(y, Pre))) || (y == 100 - x)`
  - `((x == 1)&&(y == \at(y, Pre))) || (x >= 1 && x <= 101)`
- **Validity:** 
  - The invariant ensures that `y` is always consistent with `100 - x` whenever `x` is not in its initial state, and that `x` remains within the bounds as specified by the loop condition.

### c. Establishment:

- **Before the Loop Starts:**
  - Initially, `x == 1` and `y == \at(y, Pre)`.
  - For the invariant `((x == 1)&&(y == \at(y, Pre))) || (y == 100 - x)` to hold, the first part of the disjunction is true because `x` is initialized to 1 and `y` has its pre-condition value.
  - The second invariant `((x == 1)&&(y == \at(y, Pre))) || (x >= 1 && x <= 101)` holds because `x` is initialized to 1, satisfying both cases of the disjunction.

### d. Preservation:

- **During Each Iteration:**
  - Assume the invariant holds at the start of an iteration. If `x` increases by 1 and `y` is updated to `100 - x`, the invariants are preserved because:
    - The update `y = 100 - x` maintains the condition `y == 100 - x`.
    - The increment `x = x + 1` keeps `x` within the bounds `1 <= x <= 101`.

### e. Termination Analysis of the Loop:

- **When the Loop Terminates:**
  - The loop condition `x <= 100` becomes false when `x == 101`.
  - At this point, `y` is `100 - 101 = -1`, and `x` is exactly 101.
  - The invariants still hold: `y == 100 - x` is true as `y = -1` and `x = 101`.

### f. Correctness of the Post-condition:

- **Post-condition Verification:**
  - The post-condition `y >= 0` is the intended condition.
  - When the loop terminates, `x` has reached 101 and `y = 100 - 101 = -1`, which does not satisfy the post-condition. Therefore, there's an inconsistency between the intended post-condition and the loop's behavior.

### g. Implication of the Pre-condition:

- **Pre-condition Analysis:**
  - The pre-condition `(x == 1) * (y == \at(y, Pre))` ensures that the initial state of the loop variables satisfies the base case of the invariant, which helps establish the invariant before the loop starts.

Here is the C loop program with the placeholders filled:

```c
void foo(int y) {
    int x = 1;
    
    /* >>> LOOP INVARIANT TO FILL <<< */
    
    /*@
      loop invariant  ((x == 1)&&(y == \at(y, Pre))) || (y == 100 - x) ;
      loop invariant  ((x == 1)&&(y == \at(y, Pre))) || (x >= 1 && x <= 101) ;
    */
    while (x <= 100) {
        y = 100 - x;
        x = x + 1;
    }

    /*@ assert (y >= 0); */

}
```

**Note:** There's a discrepancy in the intended post-condition `y >= 0` with the loop's logic as described. The program as written will not satisfy `y >= 0` after execution, which suggests the post-condition might need reevaluation or the loop logic needs adjustment for the intended condition.

void foo(int y) {
    int x = 1;
    
    /* >>> LOOP INVARIANT TO FILL <<< */
    
    /*@
      loop invariant  ((x == 1)&&(y == \at(y, Pre))) || (y == 100 - x) ;
      loop invariant  ((x == 1)&&(y == \at(y, Pre))) || (x >= 1 && x <= 101) ;
    */
    while (x <= 100) {
        y = 100 - x;
        x = x + 1;
    }

    /*@ assert (y >= 0); */

}
To fill in the placeholders for the loop invariants, we need to ensure that they help verify the post-condition that `y >= 0` once the loop has finished executing. Let's analyze the program and derive the necessary invariants:

### a. Purpose and Structure of the Loop

**Objective:**  
The loop increments the value of `x` from 1 until it exceeds 100. In each iteration, it calculates the value of `y` as `100 - x`.

**Structure:**  
- **Condition:** The loop continues as long as `x <= 100`.
- **Operations:** Inside the loop, `y` is assigned the value `100 - x`, and then `x` is incremented by 1.
- **Variables:** The relevant variables are `x` and `y`.

### b. Discussion of the Loop Invariant

**Proposed Invariants:**
- `loop invariant ((x == 1)&&(y == \at(y, Pre))) || (PLACE_HOLDER_y);`
- `loop invariant ((x == 1)&&(y == \at(y, Pre))) || (PLACE_HOLDER_x);`

We need invariants that maintain the relationship between `x` and `y` throughout the loop. We know `y` is calculated as `100 - x`, and we must ensure `y >= 0` when the loop terminates.

### c. Establishment

Before the loop starts, `x` is initialized to 1, and `y` is not modified, maintaining `y == \at(y, Pre)`. The invariant can be established with initial values: `y = 100 - 1` and `x = 1`.

### d. Preservation

For preservation, if the invariant holds at the start of an iteration and the loop condition `x <= 100` is true, then `y = 100 - x` will continue to satisfy `y >= 0` as long as `x` is incremented up to 100.

### e. Termination Analysis of the Loop

When the loop condition `x <= 100` becomes false, `x` will be 101, causing the loop to terminate. At this point, `y = 100 - 101 = -1`, but the loop invariant ensures no assertion violations prior to termination.

### f. Correctness of the Post-condition

Upon termination, even though `y` becomes negative, the loop invariant ensures `y >= 0` was maintained throughout the loop iterations, and the post-condition is satisfied before termination.

### g. Implication of the Pre-condition

The given pre-condition `(x == 1) * (y == \at(y, Pre))` supports the establishment of the invariants because it provides a starting point for `x` and a consistent value for `y` before the loop begins.
