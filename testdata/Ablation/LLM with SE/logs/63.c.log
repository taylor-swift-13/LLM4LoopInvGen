}
To analyze the given C program, we will fill in the placeholders for the loop invariants, ensuring they help verify the post-condition. Let's break down the task step-by-step:

### a. Purpose and Structure of the Loop

**Objective:** The loop modifies the values of `x` and `y` such that `x` increments from 1 to 11, and `y` is updated to `10 - x` in each iteration. The loop's purpose is to process `x` and `y` until `x` exceeds 10.

**Structure:** 
- **Condition:** `x <= 10`
- **Operations:** 
  - `y = 10 - x;`
  - `x = x + 1;`
- **Relevant Variables:** `x` and `y`

### b. Discussion of the Loop Invariant

The loop invariants ensure that certain properties of `x` and `y` hold throughout the loop execution. 

1. Invariant for `y`: `y == 10 - x`
2. Invariant for `x`: `1 <= x <= 10`

### c. Establishment

- **Invariant for `y`:** Initially, `x == 1` and `y = 10 - 1 = 9`. This satisfies `y == 10 - x`.
- **Invariant for `x`:** Initially, `x == 1`, which satisfies `1 <= x`.

### d. Preservation

- **Invariant for `y`:** If `y == 10 - x` and `x <= 10` at the start of an iteration, then after `y = 10 - x;` and `x = x + 1;`, it remains true that `y == 10 - x`.
- **Invariant for `x`:** If `1 <= x <= 10` at the start of an iteration, then after `x = x + 1;`, the invariant `1 <= x <= 11` holds for the next iteration.

### e. Termination Analysis of the Loop

- **Condition:** The loop terminates when `x > 10`.
- **Variables:** At termination, `x == 11` and `y == 10 - x = -1`.
- **Invariant:** The invariant `y == 10 - x` holds true when the loop terminates.

### f. Correctness of the Post-condition

- When the loop terminates, `x > 10` implies `x == 11`. This gives `y = 10 - 11 = -1`. Thus, `y >= 0` fails, but considering the logic, if the loop's logic was to ensure `y` is non-negative within loop bounds, the condition needs careful setup or the post-condition might be misaligned with the problem's logic.

### g. Implication of the Pre-condition

The pre-condition `(x == 1) * (y == \at(y, Pre))` guarantees that the initial state of the loop satisfies the established invariants.

Here is the completed C program with the filled invariants:

```c
void foo(int y) {
    int x = 1;
    
    /* >>> LOOP INVARIANT TO FILL <<< */
        
    /*@
      loop invariant  ((x == 1)&&(y == \at(y, Pre))) || (y == 10 - x) ;
      loop invariant  ((x == 1)&&(y == \at(y, Pre))) || (1 <= x <= 10) ;
    */
    while (x <= 10) {
        y = 10 - x;
        x = x + 1;
    }
    
    /*@ assert (y >= 0); */
}
```

Note: The post-condition `assert (y >= 0);` might not be valid based on the loop execution logic, as described in the analysis. Adjustments are needed if this assertion is meant to hold after the loop.

void foo(int y) {
    int x = 1;
    
    /* >>> LOOP INVARIANT TO FILL <<< */
        
    /*@
      loop invariant  ((x == 1)&&(y == \at(y, Pre))) || (y == 10 - x) ;
      loop invariant  ((x == 1)&&(y == \at(y, Pre))) || (1 <= x <= 10) ;
    */
    while (x <= 10) {
        y = 10 - x;
        x = x + 1;
    }
    
    /*@ assert (y >= 0); */
}


void foo(int y) {
    int x = 1;
    
    /* >>> LOOP INVARIANT TO FILL <<< */
        
    /*@
      loop invariant  ((x == 1)&&(y == \at(y, Pre))) || (y == 10 - x) ;
      loop invariant  ((x == 1)&&(y == \at(y, Pre))) || (1 <= x <= 10) ;
    */
    while (x <= 10) {
        y = 10 - x;
        x = x + 1;
    }
    
    /*@ assert (y >= 0); */
}

/*@
      loop invariant  ((x == 1)&&(y == \at(y, Pre))) || (y == 10 - x) ;
      loop invariant  ((x == 1)&&(y == \at(y, Pre))) || (1 <= x <= 10) ;
    */
    while (x <= 10) {
        y = 10 - x;
        x = x + 1;
    }

    /*@ assert (y >= 0); */

}
To analyze the given C loop and fill in the placeholders for the loop invariants, let's first go through the steps required:

### a. Purpose and Structure of the Loop:
- **Objective:** The loop increments `x` from 1 to 11, and during each iteration, it updates `y` to be `10 - x`.
- **Loop Structure:** The loop runs while `x <= 10`. Inside the loop, `y` is updated to `10 - x`, and `x` is incremented by 1. The relevant variables are `x` and `y`.

### b. Discussion of the Loop Invariant:
- **Loop Invariants:**
  - `((x == 1)&&(y == \at(y, Pre))) || (PLACE_HOLDER_y)` needs to express a condition linking `x` and `y` that is true throughout the loop.
  - `((x == 1)&&(y == \at(y, Pre))) || (PLACE_HOLDER_x)` needs to express a condition involving `x` that is true throughout the loop.

### c. Establishment:
- Initially, `x` is 1, and `y` is unchanged from its initial value `\at(y, Pre)`. The initial condition `(x == 1) * (y == \at(y, Pre))` is true before the loop starts.

### d. Preservation:
- If the invariants hold at the start of an iteration and the loop condition `x <= 10` is true, then after the loop body, the invariants should still hold. This means after updating `y = 10 - x` and `x = x + 1`, the conditions defined by the placeholders should still be satisfied.

### e. Termination Analysis of the Loop:
- The loop terminates when `x` becomes 11. At this point, the loop invariant should still hold, and the condition `x > 10` is true. This helps prove the post-condition.

### f. Correctness of the Post-condition:
- When the loop ends, `y` should be non-negative. Given the structure of the loop and the loop invariants, when `x > 10`, `y = 10 - (x - 1) = 10 - 10 = 0`. This satisfies the post-condition `y >= 0`.

### g. Implication of the Pre-condition:
- The pre-condition `(x == 1) * (y == \at(y, Pre))` ensures that the loop invariants are established before the loop begins execution.

Now, let's fill in the placeholders with appropriate expressions.

```c
void foo(int y) {
    int x = 1;
                
        /* >>> LOOP INVARIANT TO FILL <<< */
        
                /*@
          loop invariant  ((x == 1)&&(y == \at(y, Pre))) || (y == 10 - x) ;
          loop invariant  ((x == 1)&&(y == \at(y, Pre))) || (x >= 1 && x <= 11) ;
                */
                while (x <= 10) {
        y = 10 - x;
        x = x +1;
    }
                

    /*@ assert (y >= 0); */

}
```

- **`PLACE_HOLDER_y`**: `y == 10 - x` ensures that `y` is always set to `10 - x`, which is consistent throughout the loop.
- **`PLACE_HOLDER_x`**: `x >= 1 && x <= 11` constrains `x` to start from 1 and increment up to 11, covering all values it takes during the loop execution.

void foo(int y) {
    int x = 1;
                
                /*@
          loop invariant  ((x == 1)&&(y == \at(y, Pre))) || (y == 10 - x) ;

                while (x <= 10) {
        y = 10 - x;
        x = x +1;
    }

To analyze and generate the necessary loop invariants for the given C program, we need to understand the loop's behavior and establish conditions that remain true throughout its execution. Let's go through the analysis step by step.

### a. Purpose and Structure of the Loop:
- **Objective**: The loop increments `x` from 1 to 11, while updating `y` to be `10 - x` during each iteration.
- **Structure**:
  - **Condition**: The loop continues as long as `x <= 10`.
  - **Operations within the loop**: 
    - `y` is updated to `10 - x`.
    - `x` is incremented by 1.
  - **Relevant Variables**: `x` and `y`.

### b. Discussion of the Loop Invariant:
- **Proposed Invariant**: The loop invariant needs to express a relationship between `x` and `y` that holds true before and after every iteration, as well as at the start and end of the loop. Given the operations within the loop, the invariant can be based on the expression `y == 10 - x`.

### c. Establishment:
- **Initial Condition**: At the start, `x == 1`. The initial value of `y` is unspecified, but after the first operation (`y = 10 - x`), `y` becomes `9` (`10 - 1`). Thus, `y == 10 - x` holds true.

### d. Preservation:
- **Loop Iteration**: If `y == 10 - x` is true at the start of an iteration and `x <= 10`, then after executing `y = 10 - x` and `x = x + 1`, `y` continues to be `10 - x`, maintaining the invariant.

### e. Termination Analysis of the Loop:
- **Termination Condition**: The loop stops when `x > 10`. At this point, `y = 10 - x` is still valid as the invariant ensures it is kept during each iteration.

### f. Correctness of the Post-condition:
- **Post-condition**: After the loop, `x` is 11 (since it increments after being 10), making `y = 10 - 11 = -1`. The assertion `y >= 0` seems incorrect given the loop logic, which implies the post-condition needs to be reconsidered or corrected elsewhere.

### g. Implication of the Pre-condition:
- **Pre-condition**: The initial state with `x == 1` and `y == \at(y, Pre)` does not directly establish the invariant `y == 10 - x`. However, the initial assignment within the loop (`y = 10 - x`) ensures the invariant holds from the first iteration onwards.

Now, let's fill in the placeholders in the loop invariants:

```c
void foo(int y) {
    int x = 1;
    
    /* >>> LOOP INVARIANT TO FILL <<< */
