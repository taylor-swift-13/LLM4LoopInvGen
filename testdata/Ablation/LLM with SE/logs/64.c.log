## Analysis

### 1. Purpose and Structure of the Loop
**Objective of the Loop:**
The loop's objective is to increment the variable `x` from its initial value, `1`, to `11` while updating the variable `y` as `10 - x` in each iteration.

**Structure of the Loop:**
- **Initialization:** The variable `x` is initialized to `1`.
- **Condition:** The loop continues executing as long as `x` is less than or equal to `10`.
- **Body:**
  - `y` is updated to `10 - x`.
  - `x` is incremented by `1`.

**Relevant Variables:**
- `x`: The loop counter, starting from `1` and incremented up to `11`.
- `y`: Updated in each iteration to `10 - x`.

### 2. Discussion of the Loop Invariant
**Proposed Loop Invariant:**
```c
loop invariant  ((x == 1) && (y == \at(y, Pre))) || (y == 10 - x);
loop invariant  ((x == 1) && (y == \at(y, Pre))) || (x >= 1 && x <= 11);
```
These invariants are valid because they capture the relationship between `x` and `y` throughout the loop execution.

### 3. Establishment
The invariants hold true before the loop starts because:
- Initially, `x == 1` and `y == \at(y, Pre)` (pre-condition).

### 4. Preservation
If the invariants hold at the start of an iteration and the loop condition is true:
- After the body executes, `y` is set to `10 - x` and `x` is incremented.
- The invariants will still hold as `x` is incremented and remains within bounds.

### 5. Termination Analysis of the Loop
When the loop terminates:
- `x` has become `11`, and the loop condition `x <= 10` is false.
- The invariant `y == 10 - x` holds because `x` was `10` in the last iteration, making `y = 0`.

### 6. Correctness of the Post-condition
After the loop:
- `x == 11` and `y == 10 - 10` which implies `y == 0`.
- The post-condition `y < 10` is satisfied.

### 7. Implication of the Pre-condition
The pre-condition `x == 1` and `y == \at(y, Pre)` implies the loop invariant is established at the start.

## Code with Invariants

```c
/*@
  requires x == 1;
  requires y == \at(y, Pre);
*/
void foo(int y) {
    int x = 1;
    
    /*@
      loop invariant  ((x == 1)&&(y == \at(y, Pre))) || (y == 10 - x);
      loop invariant  ((x == 1)&&(y == \at(y, Pre))) || (x >= 1 && x <= 11);
    */
    while (x <= 10) {
        y = 10 - x;
        x = x + 1;
    }

    /*@ assert (y < 10); */
}
```

This code includes the necessary loop invariants to verify the post-condition using Frama-C.

/*@
  requires x == 1;
  requires y == \at(y, Pre);
*/
void foo(int y) {
    int x = 1;
    
    /*@
      loop invariant  ((x == 1)&&(y == \at(y, Pre))) || (y == 10 - x);
      loop invariant  ((x == 1)&&(y == \at(y, Pre))) || (x >= 1 && x <= 11);
    */
    while (x <= 10) {
        y = 10 - x;
        x = x + 1;
    }

    /*@ assert (y < 10); */

/*@

    int x = 1;
    
    /*@

    */
    while (x <= 10) {
        y = 10 - x;
        x = x + 1;
    }

    /*@ assert (y < 10); */
}

/*@

    /*@ assert (y < 10); */

}
To generate the necessary loop invariants for the given C program, let's analyze the loop and fill in the placeholders.

### Analysis

**a. Purpose and Structure of the Loop:**
- **Objective:** The loop iterates to increment the variable `x` from its initial value up to 11, modifying `y` in the process.
- **Structure:**
  - **Condition:** `x <= 10`
  - **Body:** `y = 10 - x; x = x + 1;`
  - **Variables:** `x` and `y` are relevant to the loop's behavior. `x` is initially set to 1, and `y` is updated in each iteration.

**b. Discussion of the Loop Invariant:**
- The loop invariants aim to establish conditions that hold true for every iteration of the loop. They must also imply the post-condition when the loop exits. 

**c. Establishment:**
- Before the loop starts, `x` is 1 and `y` is unchanged from its initial value. The loop invariant is true because `x == 1` and `y == \at(y, Pre)` satisfy both parts of the invariant.

**d. Preservation:**
- If the invariant holds at the start of an iteration and the loop condition is true, then after the body executes, `x` increases by 1, and `y` is set to `10 - x`. The invariant remains true because the conditions continue to hold for `x` and `y`.

**e. Termination Analysis of the Loop:**
- The loop terminates when `x > 10`. At this point, `x` is 11, and `y = 10 - x` results in `y = -1`. The invariant holds because it accounts for all possible values of `y` derived from the loop body.

**f. Correctness of the Post-condition:**
- The post-condition `y < 10` is satisfied because when the loop exits, `y = -1`, which is indeed less than 10. The loop invariant and the negation of the loop condition imply this post-condition.

**g. Implication of the Pre-condition:**
- The pre-condition asserts that `x == 1` and keeps `y` unchanged, which ensures the initial values satisfy the loop invariant.

### C Program with Filled Invariants

```c
void foo(int y) {
    int x = 1;
    
    /* >>> LOOP INVARIANT TO FILL <<< */
        
    /*@
      loop invariant  ((x == 1)&&(y == \at(y, Pre))) || (y == 10 - x) ;
      loop invariant  ((x == 1)&&(y == \at(y, Pre))) || (x >= 1 && x <= 11) ;
    */
    while (x <= 10) {
        y = 10 - x;
        x = x +1;
    }
                
    /*@ assert (y < 10); */
}
```

These invariants ensure that the loop's behavior is correctly captured, thus allowing Frama-C to verify the post-condition.

void foo(int y) {
    int x = 1;
    
    /* >>> LOOP INVARIANT TO FILL <<< */

      loop invariant  ((x == 1)&&(y == \at(y, Pre))) || (x >= 1 && x <= 11) ;
    */
    while (x <= 10) {
        y = 10 - x;
        x = x +1;
    }
                
    /*@ assert (y < 10); */

    while (x <= 10) {

    /*@ assert (y < 10); */

}
To analyze the given C program and generate appropriate loop invariants, let's break down the task into the required steps:

### a. Purpose and Structure of the Loop

**Objective of the Loop:**  
The loop's objective is to iterate while `x` is less than or equal to 10, updating the value of `y` to `10 - x` and incrementing `x` by 1 in each iteration. Essentially, it calculates `y` based on the current value of `x`.

**Structure of the Loop:**  
- **Loop Condition:** The loop continues executing while `x <= 10`.
- **Operations:** Inside the loop body, `y` is recalculated as `10 - x`, and `x` is incremented by 1.
- **Relevant Variables:** The variables `x` and `y` are relevant. `x` controls the loop's execution, and `y` is updated in each iteration based on `x`.

### b. Discussion of the Loop Invariant

**Proposed Loop Invariants:**  
- `((x == 1)&&(y == \at(y, Pre))) || (PLACE_HOLDER_y)`  
- `((x == 1)&&(y == \at(y, Pre))) || (PLACE_HOLDER_x)`

These invariants need to capture the relationship between `x` and `y` throughout the loop's execution.

### c. Establishment

**Establishment:**  
Before the loop starts, the pre-condition `(x == 1) * (y == \at(y, Pre))` is true. At this point, `x` is initialized to 1 and `y` is unchanged. Thus, the invariants hold because they include the initial condition as part of their logical expression.

### d. Preservation

**Preservation:**  
If the invariant is true at the start of an iteration and the loop condition `x <= 10` holds, the body of the loop updates `y` to `10 - x` and increments `x` by 1. The invariant must reflect that `y` is always equal to `10 - (x - 1)` before the increment, and after the increment, `y` equals `10 - x`. This relationship is preserved throughout each iteration.

### e. Termination Analysis of the Loop

**Termination:**  
When the loop condition becomes false, `x` exceeds 10. Therefore, on termination, `x` equals 11 (the first value where the condition `x <= 10` does not hold), and consequently, `y` equals `10 - 11 = -1`.

### f. Correctness of the Post-condition

**Post-condition:**  
The post-condition asserts `(y < 10)`. When the loop terminates, `y` is `-1`, which satisfies `y < 10`. The invariant ensures that `y` is correctly calculated based on `x` throughout the loop. Once the loop exits, the post-condition is guaranteed.

### g. Implication of the Pre-condition

**Pre-condition Implication:**  
The pre-condition directly sets `x` to 1 and `y` to its initial value `\at(y, Pre)`. The invariants are structured to include this initial state, ensuring they are true before the loop begins.

### Loop Invariant Filling

Based on the analysis above, the placeholders can be filled as follows:

```c
void foo(int y) {
    int x = 1;
    
        /* >>> LOOP INVARIANT TO FILL <<< */
        
                /*@
          loop invariant  ((x == 1)&&(y == \at(y, Pre))) || (y == 10 - x) ;
          loop invariant  ((x == 1)&&(y == \at(y, Pre))) || (x >= 1 && x <= 11) ;
                */
                while (x <= 10) {
        y = 10 - x;
        x = x +1;
    }
                

    /*@ assert (y < 10); */

}
```

void foo(int y) {
    int x = 1;
    
                /*@
          loop invariant  ((x == 1)&&(y == \at(y, Pre))) || (y == 10 - x) ;
          loop invariant  ((x == 1)&&(y == \at(y, Pre))) || (x >= 1 && x <= 11) ;
                */
                while (x <= 10) {
        y = 10 - x;
        x = x +1;
