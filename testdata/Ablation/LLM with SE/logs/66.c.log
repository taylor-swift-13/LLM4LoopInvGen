Certainly! Let's go through the analysis and fill in the placeholders with appropriate loop invariants.

### Analysis and Loop Invariants

#### a. Purpose and Structure of the Loop:
- **Objective**: The loop iterates while `x` is less than or equal to 100, updating `y` to `100 - x` and incrementing `x`. The intended outcome is to ensure that `y` is less than 100 once the loop exits.
- **Structure**: 
  - **Condition**: The loop continues executing as long as `x <= 100`.
  - **Operations**: In each iteration, `y` is set to `100 - x`, and `x` is incremented by 1.
  - **Relevant Variables**: `x` and `y`.

#### b. Discussion of the Loop Invariant:
- The loop invariant must maintain a relationship between `x` and `y` that holds true before, during, and after the loop. It needs to capture the relationship that `y` is always `100 - x` during the loop execution.

#### c. Establishment:
- Before the loop starts, `x` is initialized to 1, and the pre-condition states that `y` is equal to its initial value. The invariant involving `y = 100 - x` is true when the loop starts because initially, `y` is updated to `100 - 1 = 99`.

#### d. Preservation:
- If the invariant holds at the start of an iteration, and the loop condition `x <= 100` is true, the operations within the loop (`y = 100 - x; x = x + 1;`) preserve the invariant, as `y` is always updated to `100 - x`.

#### e. Termination Analysis of the Loop:
- The loop terminates when `x` becomes 101. At this point, `y` is `100 - x`, which equals `100 - 101 = -1`. The invariant still holds because it always maintains the relationship `y = 100 - x`.

#### f. Correctness of the Post-condition:
- The post-condition `y < 100` is ensured because when the loop exits, `x` is 101, making `y = 100 - 101 = -1`, which is less than 100.

#### g. Implication of the Pre-condition:
- The pre-condition `x == 1` and `y == \at(y, Pre)` ensures that when the loop starts, `y` is set to `100 - x`, which is 99, establishing the invariant `y = 100 - x`.

### Filled-In Loop Invariants

```c
void foo(int y) {
    int x = 1;

    /* >>> LOOP INVARIANT TO FILL <<< */
        
    /*@
      loop invariant  ((x == 1)&&(y == \at(y, Pre))) || (y == 100 - x) ;
      loop invariant  ((x == 1)&&(y == \at(y, Pre))) || (x >= 1 && x <= 101) ;
    */
    while (x <= 100) {
        y = 100 - x;
        x = x + 1;
    }

    /*@ assert (y < 100); */
}
```

These loop invariants capture the relationship between `x` and `y` throughout the loop's execution and ensure the correctness of the program's post-condition.

    while (x <= 100) {

}
To analyze the given C program and fill in the loop invariants, let's perform the required analysis steps:

### a. Purpose and Structure of the Loop

**Objective:**  
The loop's objective is to increment `x` from 1 to 101 while simultaneously updating `y` to `100 - x` in each iteration. 

**Structure:**  
- **Loop Condition:** The loop continues as long as `x <= 100`.
- **Operations within the Body:**
  - `y` is updated to `100 - x`.
  - `x` is incremented by 1.
- **Relevant Variables:**  
  - `x`: Starts at 1 and is incremented until it exceeds 100.
  - `y`: Updated in each loop iteration to `100 - x`.

### b. Discussion of the Loop Invariant

**Proposed Invariant:**  
- `((x == 1)&&(y == \at(y, Pre))) || (y == 100 - x)`
- `((x == 1)&&(y == \at(y, Pre))) || (x >= 1 && x <= 101)`

These invariants capture the relationships between `x` and `y` throughout the loop execution.

### c. Establishment

**Invariant Establishment:**  
- Before the loop starts, `x == 1` and `y` has its original value `\at(y, Pre)`. Thus, `((x == 1)&&(y == \at(y, Pre)))` is true, establishing the invariant.

### d. Preservation

**Invariant Preservation:**  
- At the start of each iteration, if `y == 100 - x` and `x` is incremented, then before the next iteration starts, `y` is set to `100 - (x + 1)`, keeping the invariant true.
- `x` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, maintaining `x >= 1 && x <= 101`.

### e. Termination Analysis of the Loop

**Loop Termination:**  
- The loop condition `x <= 100` becomes false when `x` is 101. At this point, `y` will be `100 - 101 = -1`, ensuring `y < 100` holds true.

### f. Correctness of the Post-condition

**Post-condition Validity:**  
- When the loop ends, `x` is 101, making `y = 100 - 101 = -1` which satisfies the post-condition `y < 100`.

### g. Implication of the Pre-condition

**Pre-condition Implication:**  
- The pre-condition `(x == 1) * (y == \at(y, Pre))` directly establishes the initial truth of the invariant `((x == 1)&&(y == \at(y, Pre)))`, ensuring the invariant is valid before the loop begins.

Here is the complete C loop program with the placeholders filled in:

}
To analyze the given loop and generate the necessary loop invariants, let's go through the process step-by-step:

### a. Purpose and Structure of the Loop:
**Objective:** The loop aims to increment `x` from its initial value until it becomes greater than 100, while updating `y` such that `y = 100 - x`.

**Structure:** 
- **Loop Condition:** The loop continues as long as `x <= 100`.
- **Operations:** Inside the loop, `y` is set to `100 - x`, and `x` is incremented by 1.
- **Relevant Variables:** `x` and `y` are the variables that govern the loop's behavior.

### b. Discussion of the Loop Invariant:
The loop invariant must capture the relationship between `x` and `y` throughout the execution of the loop. It also needs to maintain the pre-condition that `x` starts at 1 and `y` retains its initial value until `x` changes.

### c. Establishment:
Before the loop begins, `x` is initialized to 1, and `y` is equal to its initial value as per the pre-condition. Thus, the invariant holds true initially.

### d. Preservation:
Throughout each iteration, as `x` is incremented and `y` is set to `100 - x`, the invariant ensures that the relationship between `x` and `y` is maintained.

### e. Termination Analysis of the Loop:
When `x` becomes 101, the loop condition `x <= 100` is false, and the loop terminates. At this point, `y = 100 - x = 100 - 101 = -1`, which satisfies the post-condition `y < 100`.

### f. Correctness of the Post-condition:
The loop invariant and the negation of the loop condition ensure that `y = 100 - x`, and when `x > 100`, `y < 100` is satisfied.

### g. Implication of the Pre-condition:
The pre-condition implies the initial values required to establish the invariant. `x` starts at 1, and `y` begins as its initial value, making the invariant true at the start.

### Filled-in ACSL Annotations:
```c
void foo(int y) {
    int x = 1;
    
    /* >>> LOOP INVARIANT TO FILL <<< */
    
    /*@
      loop invariant  ((x == 1)&&(y == \at(y, Pre))) || (y == 100 - x) ;
      loop invariant  ((x == 1)&&(y == \at(y, Pre))) || (x >= 1 && x <= 101) ;
    */
    while (x <= 100) {
        y = 100 - x;
        x = x + 1;
    }
    
    /*@ assert (y < 100); */
}
```

These invariants ensure that the relationship between `x` and `y` holds true throughout the loop, and they help verify the post-condition.

void foo(int y) {
    int x = 1;
    
    /* >>> LOOP INVARIANT TO FILL <<< */
