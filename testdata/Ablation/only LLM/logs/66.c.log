### Analysis

#### a. Purpose and Structure of the Loop
**Objective of the Loop:**
The objective of the loop is to increment the variable `x` from 1 to 101 and to update the variable `y` such that `y` always equals `100 - x`.

**Structure of the Loop:**
- **Loop Condition:** `x <= 100`
- **Operations within the Loop Body:**
  - `y = 100 - x;`
  - `x = x + 1;`
- **Relevant Variables:** `x`, `y`

#### b. Discussion of the Loop Invariant
**Proposed Loop Invariant:**
```c
/*@ loop invariant 1 <= x <= 101;
    loop invariant y == 100 - x + 1;
*/
```
**Explanation:**
- The first part, `1 <= x <= 101`, ensures that the variable `x` is always within the expected range during the loop execution.
- The second part, `y == 100 - x + 1`, maintains the relationship between `x` and `y` based on the operations performed within the loop.

#### c. Establishment
**Initial State Before the Loop:**
- `x = 1`
- Before the loop starts, `y` is not yet defined, but the invariant `y == 100 - x + 1` will hold after the first iteration.
- Initial invariant conditions: `1 <= x <= 101` and `y == 100 - x + 1`.

#### d. Preservation
**Preservation Analysis:**
- Assume the invariant holds at the start of an iteration.
- After `y = 100 - x;` and `x = x + 1;`, the invariant must still hold:
  - `1 <= x <= 100` is preserved since `x` is incremented by 1 and initially `x <= 100`.
  - If `y == 100 - x + 1` before the increment, then after `x = x + 1`, `y` becomes `100 - (x + 1 - 1)` which simplifies to `100 - x`. This is consistent with the loop invariant `y == 100 - x + 1`.

#### e. Termination Analysis of the Loop
**Condition for Loop Termination:**
- The loop terminates when `x > 100`.
- At termination, `x == 101`.
- Substituting `x = 101` into the invariant `y == 100 - x + 1`, we get `y == 100 - 101 + 1` which simplifies to `y == 0`.

#### f. Correctness of the Post-condition
**Post-condition:**
- The post-condition asserts `(y < 100)`.
- When the loop terminates, `y == 0`, which satisfies `y < 100`.
- Thus, the loop invariant combined with the negation of the loop condition ensures that the post-condition is met.

### Analysis

#### a. Purpose and Structure of the Loop
- **Objective**: The loop iterates from `x = 1` to `x = 100`, decrementing `y` from `99` to `0`.
- **Loop Structure**:
  - **Condition**: `x <= 100`
  - **Body**: 
    - `y = 100 - x;`
    - `x = x + 1;`
  - **Relevant variables**: `x`, `y`

#### b. Discussion of the Loop Invariant
- **Proposed Loop Invariant**: `1 <= x <= 101` and `y == 100 - x`
- **Validity**: 
  - `1 <= x <= 101` ensures that `x` stays within the bounds during the loop.
  - `y == 100 - x` describes the relationship between `x` and `y` throughout the loop.

#### c. Establishment
- **Before the loop starts**:
  - `x = 1`
  - `y = 100 - 1 = 99`
- The invariant `1 <= x <= 101` and `y == 100 - x` holds because initially `x = 1` and `y = 99`.

#### d. Preservation
- **During the loop**:
  - Assume the invariant holds at the start of an iteration: `1 <= x <= 100` and `y == 100 - x`.
  - After the loop body:
    - `y = 100 - x` is executed.
    - `x = x + 1` is executed.
  - At the end of the iteration:
    - `x` is incremented by 1, so `1 <= x <= 101` still holds.
    - `y` is updated to `100 - (x + 1)`, which still satisfies `y == 100 - x`.

#### e. Termination Analysis of the Loop
- **When the loop terminates**:
  - The loop condition `x <= 100` is false, so `x > 100`.
  - Therefore, `x` must be `101` (since `x` increments by 1 each iteration).
  - Given `x = 101`, `y = 100 - (x - 1) = 100 - 100 = 0`.
- The invariant `1 <= x <= 101` and `y == 100 - x` still holds with `x = 101` and `y = 0`.

#### f. Correctness of the Post-condition
- **Post-condition**: `y < 100`
- When the loop terminates, `x = 101`, thus `y = 100 - 101 = -1`.
- Therefore, `y < 100` holds true.

Sure, let's analyze the given C program and generate the necessary loop invariants.

**a. Purpose and Structure of the Loop:**

- **Objective:** The loop's objective is to increment the variable `x` from 1 to 100 and adjust the value of `y` accordingly to `100 - x` in each iteration.
- **Structure:**
  - **Condition:** The loop executes as long as `x` is less than or equal to 100 (`x <= 100`).
  - **Operations:** Within the loop body, `y` is updated to `100 - x`, and `x` is incremented by 1.
  - **Relevant Variables:** `x` and `y`.

**b. Discussion of the Loop Invariant:**

A suitable loop invariant for this loop should express:
- The relationship between `x` and `y`.
- The bounds on `x`.

Proposed invariant:
- `1 <= x <= 101`
- `y == 100 - (x - 1)`

**c. Establishment:**

Before the loop starts, `x` is initialized to 1.
- `1 <= x <= 101` holds true since `x` is 1.
- `y == 100 - (x - 1)` holds true because initially `y` is assigned as `100 - x` and `x` is 1, so `y` becomes `99` which is `100 - (1 - 1)`.

**d. Preservation:**

Assume the invariant holds at the start of an iteration:
- `1 <= x <= 101`
- `y == 100 - (x - 1)`

Within the loop:
- `y` is updated to `100 - x`.
- `x` is incremented by 1 (`x = x + 1`).

After incrementing `x`:
- `1 <= x <= 100` still holds true since `x` is incremented by 1 but not more than 101.
- `y == 100 - (x - 1)` still holds because after updating `y` to `100 - x` and then incrementing `x`, the invariant is preserved.

**e. Termination Analysis of the Loop:**

The loop terminates when `x > 100`.
- When `x` reaches 101, the loop condition `x <= 100` becomes false.
- At this point, `y` would be `100 - 100 = 0`, ensuring that `y < 100` holds true.

**f. Correctness of the Post-condition:**

When the loop terminates:
- `x` is 101.
- `y` is `100 - 100 + 1 = 0`, which is less than 100.

The invariant `1 <= x <= 101` and `y == 100 - (x - 1)` combined with the negation of the loop condition (`x > 100`) ensures that `y < 100` holds true.

Now, let's provide the annotated C code:

```c
void foo(int y) {
    int x = 1;
    
    /*@ loop invariant 1 <= x <= 101;
      @ loop invariant y == 100 - (x - 1);
      @ loop assigns x, y;
      @*/
    while (x <= 100) {
        y = 100 - x;
        x = x + 1;
    }

    /*@ assert (y < 100); */
}
```

This annotated code should help Frama-C verify the post-condition of the program.

void foo(int y) {
    int x = 1;
    
    /*@ loop invariant 1 <= x <= 101;
      @ loop invariant y == 100 - (x - 1);
      @ loop assigns x, y;
      @*/
    while (x <= 100) {
        y = 100 - x;
        x = x + 1;
    }

    /*@ assert (y < 100); */
}
