To address the task at hand, let's perform the required analysis:

### Analysis

#### a. Purpose and Structure of the Loop:
The objective of the loop is to iteratively update the values of `x` and `y` by setting them both to the sum of their current values (`t1 + t2`). The loop continues executing as long as the function `unknown()` returns a non-zero value, implying that the loop can potentially execute any number of times. The relevant variables in the loop are `x`, `y`, `t1`, and `t2`, with `x` and `y` being updated in each iteration.

#### b. Discussion of the Loop Invariant:
The proposed loop invariants are intended to capture relationships between `x` and `y` that hold true throughout the execution of the loop. The placeholders `PLACE_HOLDER_x` and `PLACE_HOLDER_y` need to be filled with expressions that reflect these relationships and satisfy the conditions of an invariant.

#### c. Establishment:
The invariants must be established before the loop begins. Given the pre-condition `(y == 1) * (x == 1)`, the invariants are initially true because `x` and `y` both start with the value `1`, satisfying the initial conditions of the proposed invariants.

#### d. Preservation:
The invariants must remain true throughout each iteration of the loop. Since both `x` and `y` are updated to `t1 + t2` in each iteration, the relationship between `x` and `y` must be preserved by the expressions filled in the placeholders.

#### e. Termination Analysis of the Loop:
When the loop terminates, the loop condition `unknown()` becomes false, meaning that no further updates occur. The invariants must still hold true under these conditions, which implies a stable relationship between `x` and `y`.

#### f. Correctness of the Post-condition:
The post-condition `y >= 1` must be satisfied once the loop finishes executing. The invariants combined with the termination condition ensure that `y` remains non-negative and satisfies the post-condition.

#### g. Implication of the Pre-condition:
The pre-condition `(y == 1) * (x == 1)` directly implies the initial truth of the loop invariants, as they are established based on this initial condition.

### Filled C Loop Program:

```c
int unknown();

void foo()
{
 int x = 1;
 int y = 1;

 
            
    /* >>> LOOP INVARIANT TO FILL <<< 
       >>> PRECONDITION OF THE LOOP : (y == 1) * (x == 1) <<< */
    
            /*@
          loop invariant  ((y == 1)&&(x == 1)) || (x >= 1) ;
          loop invariant  ((y == 1)&&(x == 1)) || (y >= 1) ;
            */
            while(unknown()) {
   int t1 = x;
   int t2 = y;
   x = t1 + t2;
   y = t1 + t2;
 }
            
 /*@ assert y >= 1 ;*/
}
```

In this program, the placeholders for the invariants have been filled with `x >= 1` and `y >= 1`, which are consistent with the pre-condition and ensure that the post-condition is met upon termination of the loop.

int unknown();

void foo()
{
 int x = 1;
 int y = 1;

 
            
            /*@
          loop invariant  ((y == 1)&&(x == 1)) || (x >= 1) ;
          loop invariant  ((y == 1)&&(x == 1)) || (y >= 1) ;
            */
            while(unknown()) {
   int t1 = x;
   int t2 = y;
   x = t1 + t2;
   y = t1 + t2;
 }
            
 /*@ assert y >= 1 ;*/
}


int unknown();

void foo()
{
 int x = 1;
 int y = 1;

 
            
            /*@
          loop invariant  ((y == 1)&&(x == 1)) || (x >= 1) ;
          loop invariant  ((y == 1)&&(x == 1)) || (y >= 1) ;
            */
            while(unknown()) {
   int t1 = x;
   int t2 = y;
   x = t1 + t2;
   y = t1 + t2;
 }
            
 /*@ assert y >= 1 ;*/
}
