<think>Alright, I'm given a C program with a loop and need to identify loop invariants that can help verify the post-condition using Frama-C. Let me analyze this program:

The program has:
- Two integer parameters `x` and `y`
- `x` is initialized to -50
- The loop runs while `x < 0`
- In each iteration, `x` is increased by `y`, and `y` is incremented by 1
- After the loop, there's an assertion that `y > 0`

The pre-condition is: `(y == \at(y, Pre)) * (x == -50)`
This means initially, `x` is -50 and `y` has its original input value.

I need to fill in two placeholders in the loop invariants:
- `PLACE_HOLDER_x` 
- `PLACE_HOLDER_y`

Let me analyze how this loop behaves:

1. Initially, `x = -50` and `y` has some value (let's call it `y_initial`)
2. In each iteration:
   - `x = x + y`
   - `y = y + 1`
3. The loop terminates when `x >= 0`
4. The post-condition requires `y > 0`

To find the invariants, I need to track how `x` and `y` change during the loop:

Let's say the loop runs for `n` iterations (where `n` is initially unknown).
After `n` iterations:
- `y` will be `y_initial + n`
- `x` will depend on the sum of `y` values across iterations

For the first iteration:
- `x = -50 + y_initial`
- `y = y_initial + 1`

For the second iteration:
- `x = (-50 + y_initial) + (y_initial + 1) = -50 + 2*y_initial + 1`
- `y = y_initial + 2`

For the third iteration:
- `x = -50 + 2*y_initial + 1 + (y_initial + 2) = -50 + 3*y_initial + 3`
- `y = y_initial + 3`

I'm seeing a pattern. After `n` iterations:
- `y = y_initial + n`
- `x = -50 + y_initial*n + (0+1+2+...+(n-1))` 
- The sum `0+1+2+...+(n-1) = n*(n-1)/2`

So: `x = -50 + y_initial*n + n*(n-1)/2`

Let's rewrite this in terms of the current `y` value.
If `y = y_initial + n`, then `n = y - y_initial`

Substituting:
`x = -50 + y_initial*(y - y_initial) + (y - y_initial)*((y - y_initial)-1)/2`
`x = -50 + y_initial*y - y_initialÂ² + (y - y_initial)*(y - y_initial - 1)/2`

This is getting complex. Let me rethink.

Actually, a loop invariant doesn't have to capture the exact formula for `x`. It just needs to be something that's true before the loop, stays true during each iteration, and helps prove the post-condition.

Since the first part of the invariant is already `((y == \at(y, Pre))&&(x == -50))`, which covers the initial state, I need to focus on what's true after the loop has executed at least once.

Looking at the loop's behavior:
1. `x` increases by at least `y` in each iteration, and `y` increases by 1.
2. The loop only terminates when `x >= 0`, which means to exit the loop, `x` must have accumulated enough positive increments.

I think a simpler invariant might be sufficient. Let me consider:

For `PLACE_HOLDER_x`, I want to capture the relationship between `x` and `y` as the loop executes:
- `x` starts at -50
- After each iteration, `x` depends on the sum of previous `y` values

For `PLACE_HOLDER_y`, I need to relate `y` to its initial value:
- `y` starts at its initial value
- After each iteration, `y` increases by 1

So for `PLACE_HOLDER_y`, I can use: `y > \at(y, Pre)`
This captures that once the loop has run at least once, `y` is greater than its initial value.

For `PLACE_HOLDER_x`, it's more complex. I know that `x` depends on the sum of previous `y` values, but there's no simple formula. However, I know that as `y` increases, `x` increases more quickly, and eventually `x >= 0`, at which point the loop terminates.

Let me simply state that `x` is moving toward 0 each iteration: `x > -50`
This indicates that `x` has increased from its initial value.

With these placeholders:
- `PLACE_HOLDER_x`: `x > -50`
- `PLACE_HOLDER_y`: `y > \at(y, Pre)`

Let me check if these invariants are sufficient:

1. Establishment: The invariants are true before the loop, covered by the first part of the invariant.
2. Preservation: If the invariants are true at the start of an iteration and `x < 0`:
   - `x` increases by `y` (which is at least y_initial), so `x > -50` remains true
   - `y` increases by 1, so `y > \at(y, Pre)` remains true
3. Termination: When the loop terminates, `x >= 0` and `y > \at(y, Pre)`

The post-condition is `y > 0`. To show this is true after the loop, I need to show that `y > \at(y, Pre)` and `x >= 0` imply `y > 0`.

Wait, that doesn't necessarily work. If `\at(y, Pre) <= 0`, then `y > \at(y, Pre)` doesn't guarantee `y > 0`.

I need to reconsider. Actually, I think we need to understand the relationship between `x` and `y` more precisely.

Let me take another approach. At each iteration:
- `x` increases by the current value of `y`
- `y` increases by 1

So, after `n` iterations:
- `y = \at(y, Pre) + n`
- `x = -50 + sum(y_0, y_1, ..., y_{n-1})`
  where `y_i = \at(y, Pre) + i`

This means:
- `x = -50 + \at(y, Pre)*n + (0+1+2+...+(n-1))`
- `x = -50 + \at(y, Pre)*n + n*(n-1)/2`

Since `y = \at(y, Pre) + n`, we can solve for `n`:
- `n = y - \at(y, Pre)`

Substituting:
- `x = -50 + \at(y, Pre)*(y - \at(y, Pre)) + (y - \at(y, Pre))*((y - \at(y, Pre))-1)/2`

That's our relationship between `x`, `y`, and `\at(y, Pre)`. We can simplify this as:
- `x = -50 + \at(y, Pre)*(y - \at(y, Pre)) + (y - \at(y, Pre))*(y - \at(y, Pre) - 1)/2`

For the loop invariant, this gives us:
- `PLACE_HOLDER_x`: `x == -50 + \at(y, Pre)*(y - \at(y, Pre)) + (y - \at(y, Pre))*(y - \at(y, Pre) - 1)/2`
- `PLACE_HOLDER_y`: `y > \at(y, Pre)`

Let me verify this works:

1. Establishment: Before the loop, `y = \at(y, Pre)` and `x = -50`, so the first part of the invariant applies.
2. Preservation: If the invariants are true at the start of an iteration and `x < 0`:
   - After the iteration, `y` is increased by 1, so `y > \at(y, Pre)` remains true
   - The formula for `x` is updated to account for the new value of `y`
3. Termination: When the loop terminates, `x >= 0`.

With this, can we prove the post-condition `y > 0`?

When the loop terminates, `x >= 0`. From our invariant:
`x = -50 + \at(y, Pre)*(y - \at(y, Pre)) + (y - \at(y, Pre))*(y - \at(y, Pre) - 1)/2 >= 0`

I need to show that this implies `y > 0`.

Let's simplify the formula a bit. Let `d = y - \at(y, Pre)`, which is the number of iterations.
`x = -50 + \at(y, Pre)*d + d*(d-1)/2 >= 0`

For the loop to terminate, `d` must be large enough to make `x >= 0`. As `d` increases, the terms `\at(y, Pre)*d` and `d*(d-1)/2` increase.

However, this doesn't directly give us a constraint on `y` at termination. But I can derive one:

If `x >= 0` at termination, then the loop must have executed enough times to add sufficient positive values to `x`. Since `y` is incremented each time, and we know `y = \at(y, Pre) + d`, I need to derive a minimum value for `d` from the condition `x >= 0`.

Actually, I realize the invariant as I've written it doesn't really prove the post-condition. Let me reconsider what invariants would be useful.

Since the post-condition is `y > 0`, I need the invariant to somehow relate `y`'s value to a positive condition.

Let's look at the loop behavior again:
- `x` starts at -50
- Each iteration, `x` increases by `y` and `y` increases by 1
- The loop continues until `x >= 0`

For the loop to terminate, `y` must eventually become large enough to make `x >= 0`. If `\at(y, Pre)` is very negative, then `y` needs to increase a lot before it can push `x` above 0.

Let me adjust the invariants:

- `PLACE_HOLDER_x`: `x == -50 + \at(y, Pre)*(y - \at(y, Pre)) + (y - \at(y, Pre))*(y - \at(y, Pre) - 1)/2`
- `PLACE_HOLDER_y`: `y > \at(y, Pre)`

These capture the behavior of the loop. When the loop terminates:
- `x >= 0`
- The formula for `x` still holds

I know that for `x` to become non-negative, `y` must have increased enough. Let me analyze this:

If `\at(y, Pre) <= 0`, then initially `y` isn't helping (or is hurting) `x`'s progress toward 0. But as `y` increases, it eventually becomes positive, and each iteration helps `x` progress more toward 0.

Since the loop terminates when `x >= 0`, and `x` can only reach 0 if `y` is providing positive increments, `y` must have reached a positive value by the time the loop terminates.

So, the post-condition `y > 0` is implied by the loop termination, but we'd need to show this formally using the invariants.

Given my analysis, I believe the invariants should be:

- `PLACE_HOLDER_x`: `x == -50 + \at(y, Pre)*(y - \at(y, Pre)) + (y - \at(y, Pre))*(y - \at(y, Pre) - 1)/2`
- `PLACE_HOLDER_y`: `y > \at(y, Pre)`

These invariants correctly describe the relationship between `x` and `y` during the loop's execution.</think>

# Loop Invariant Analysis for the Given C Program

## A. Purpose and Structure of the Loop

**Purpose**: The loop's objective is to increase the value of `x` (starting from -50) until it becomes non-negative, while incrementing `y` with each iteration.

**Structure**:
- The loop executes while `x < 0`
- In each iteration:
  - `x` is increased by the current value of `y`
  - `y` is incremented by 1
- Relevant variables: `x` and `y`

## B. Discussion of the Loop Invariant

I've identified the following loop invariants:
1. For `x`: `x == -50 + \at(y, Pre)*(y - \at(y, Pre)) + (y - \at(y, Pre))*(y - \at(y, Pre) - 1)/2`
2. For `y`: `y > \at(y, Pre)`

These invariants describe the exact relationship between `x` and `y` as the loop executes. The first invariant captures the mathematical formula for `x` after any number of iterations, while the second invariant shows that `y` strictly increases from its initial value.

## C. Establishment

Before the loop begins:
- `x` is initialized to -50
- `y` has its original value (`\at(y, Pre)`)

At this point, `y - \at(y, Pre) = 0`, so the first term of our invariant for `x` evaluates to `-50`, which matches the initial value of `x`. The second part of the disjunction doesn't apply initially, so the invariant holds.

## D. Preservation

Assume the invariants hold at the start of an iteration:
- `x = -50 + \at(y, Pre)*(y - \at(y, Pre)) + (y - \at(y, Pre))*(y - \at(y, Pre) - 1)/2`
- `y > \at(y, Pre)` (if we've executed at least one iteration)

After executing the loop body:
- `y_new = y + 1`
- `x_new = x + y = -50 + \at(y, Pre)*(y - \at(y, Pre)) + (y - \at(y, Pre))*(y - \at(y, Pre) - 1)/2 + y`

Let's denote `d = y - \at(y, Pre)` (the number of iterations completed):
- `x = -50 + \at(y, Pre)*d + d*(d-1)/2`
- After the iteration, `d_new = d + 1`

We need to show that:
`x_new = -50 + \at(y, Pre)*d_new + d_new*(d_new-1)/2`

Substituting:
`x_new = -50 + \at(y, Pre)*d + d*(d-1)/2 + (\at(y, Pre) + d)`
`x_new = -50 + \at(y, Pre)*d + d*(d-1)/2 + \at(y, Pre) + d`
`x_new = -50 + \at(y, Pre)*(d+1) + d*(d-1)/2 + d`
`x_new = -50 + \at(y, Pre)*(d+1) + (dÂ²-d)/2 + d`
`x_new = -50 + \at(y, Pre)*(d+1) + (dÂ²-d+2d)/2`
`x_new = -50 + \at(y, Pre)*(d+1) + (dÂ²+d)/2`
`x_new = -50 + \at(y, Pre)*(d+1) + (d+1)*d/2`
`x_new = -50 + \at(y, Pre)*(d+1) + (d+1)*(d+1-1)/2`

This matches our invariant formula for the new values, so the invariant is preserved.

The second invariant `y > \at(y, Pre)` is clearly preserved as `y` increases with each iteration.

## E. Termination Analysis

The loop terminates when `x â¥ 0`. Using our invariant:
`-50 + \at(y, Pre)*(y - \at(y, Pre)) + (y - \at(y, Pre))*(y - \at(y, Pre) - 1)/2 â¥ 0`

At termination, the invariant still holds, and we know `y > \at(y, Pre)` due to the increments in the loop.

## F. Correctness of the Post-condition

The post-condition is `y > 0`. To prove this, we need to show that when the loop terminates, `y` must be positive.

From our loop termination condition:
`-50 + \at(y, Pre)*(y - \at(y, Pre)) + (y - \at(y, Pre))*(y - \at(y, Pre) - 1)/2 â¥ 0`

For this to be satisfied, `y` must have increased enough from its initial value to make the expression non-negative. 

If we examine the loop behavior:
- If `\at(y, Pre) â¤ 0`, then initially the increments to `x` are non-positive
- As `y` increases with each iteration, eventually `y` becomes positive
- Once `y` is positive, `x` starts receiving positive increments
- For `x` to reach a non-negative value (starting from -50), `y` must have become positive

Therefore, by the time the loop terminates, `y > 0` must hold.

## G. Implication of the Pre-condition

The pre-condition `(y == \at(y, Pre)) * (x == -50)` directly establishes our loop invariant:
- It sets `x` to -50
- It establishes that `y` equals its initial value

When we substitute these values into our invariant, with `y - \at(y, Pre) = 0`, the formula for `x` evaluates to -50, which matches the initial value. Therefore, the pre-condition directly implies the loop invariant.
