<think>This problem asks me to identify appropriate loop invariants for a C program and fill in the placeholders with expressions that will help Frama-C verify the post-condition.

Let me analyze the program:

1. Pre-condition: `(y == 1) * (x == 1)` which essentially means `y == 1 AND x == 1`
2. There's a loop with an unknown number of iterations (determined by `unknown()`)
3. In each iteration, the program:
   - Stores x in t1 and y in t2
   - Sets x = t1 + t2
   - Sets y = t1 + t2
4. Post-condition: `y >= 1`

Let's trace through a few iterations to understand the pattern:

Initial state: x = 1, y = 1

After 1st iteration:
- t1 = 1, t2 = 1
- x = 1 + 1 = 2
- y = 1 + 1 = 2

After 2nd iteration:
- t1 = 2, t2 = 2
- x = 2 + 2 = 4
- y = 2 + 2 = 4

After 3rd iteration:
- t1 = 4, t2 = 4
- x = 4 + 4 = 8
- y = 4 + 4 = 8

I notice that:
1. x and y are always equal after the first iteration
2. They both double in value after each iteration
3. Both x and y are always ≥ 1 (starting at 1 and growing)
4. More precisely, after n iterations: x = y = 2^n

Now, let's identify the appropriate invariants to fill in the placeholders:

For PLACE_HOLDER_x: 
Since after the first iteration, x and y are always equal, we need to express that x = y. And we know that both x and y are at least 1 (and grow with iterations), so x ≥ 1.

For PLACE_HOLDER_y:
Similarly, y = x and y ≥ 1.

So the invariants would be:
- PLACE_HOLDER_x: (x == y) && (x >= 1)
- PLACE_HOLDER_y: (y == x) && (y >= 1)

Let's check these against the invariant properties:

1. Establishment (before loop):
   - Initial state: x = 1, y = 1
   - First part of invariant: ((y == 1)&&(x == 1)) is true
   - Second part: (x == y) && (x >= 1) is also true
   - Third part: (y == x) && (y >= 1) is also true

2. Preservation (during loop):
   - If x = y ≥ 1 at start of iteration
   - Then after x = t1 + t2 = x + y = 2x (since x = y)
   - And after y = t1 + t2 = x + y = 2x (also 2y, since x = y)
   - So x = y still holds, and both are ≥ 1 (in fact, they're double their previous values)

3. Termination:
   - When loop terminates, one of the invariants must be true:
   - Either ((y == 1)&&(x == 1)) OR ((x == y) && (x >= 1))
   - Since x and y start at 1 and can only increase, the invariant guarantees y ≥ 1
   - Therefore the post-condition y ≥ 1 is satisfied

This seems like a correct invariant for this program. Let me now format the complete answer according to the requested structure.</think>

# Loop Invariant Analysis for C Program

## Analysis

### a. Purpose and Structure of the Loop

The purpose of this loop is to repeatedly modify variables x and y, which both start with value 1. In each iteration, the loop:
- Stores the current values of x and y in temporary variables t1 and t2
- Updates both x and y to be the sum of their previous values (t1 + t2)

The loop executes an unknown number of times as determined by the `unknown()` function. The relevant variables are x and y, which both start at 1 and are modified within the loop.

### b. Discussion of the Loop Invariant

The proposed loop invariant has two parts:
1. `((y == 1)&&(x == 1)) || ((x == y) && (x >= 1))`
2. `((y == 1)&&(x == 1)) || ((y == x) && (y >= 1))`

This invariant captures two possible states:
- Either we're at the initial state where both x and y are 1
- Or we've entered the loop at least once, in which case x equals y and both are greater than or equal to 1

This is a valid invariant because it holds true before the loop starts and after each iteration, and it's strong enough to prove the post-condition.

### c. Establishment

Before the loop begins, the pre-condition `(y == 1) * (x == 1)` holds, which means both x and y are 1. This directly satisfies the first part of our invariant `((y == 1)&&(x == 1))`, making the entire invariant true before the loop starts.

### d. Preservation

If the invariant holds at the beginning of an iteration, then either:
- x = y = 1 (first iteration)
- x = y ≥ 1 (subsequent iterations)

In either case, after executing the loop body:
- t1 = x and t2 = y
- x = t1 + t2 = x + y
- y = t1 + t2 = x + y

Since x and y get the same value (their sum), they remain equal. And since both were at least 1 before, their sum will be at least 2, which is also ≥ 1. This preserves the second part of our invariant.

### e. Termination Analysis of the Loop

When the loop terminates, the invariant still holds true. Either:
- x = y = 1 (if the loop never executed)
- x = y ≥ 1 (if the loop executed at least once)

In fact, after n iterations, x = y = 2^n (they double each time), which means they grow exponentially with each iteration.

### f. Correctness of the Post-condition

The post-condition is `y >= 1`. Our invariant guarantees that either:
- y = 1 (first part of invariant)
- y ≥ 1 (second part of invariant)

In both cases, y ≥ 1 is satisfied, which means the post-condition holds true when the loop terminates.

### g. Implication of the Pre-condition

The pre-condition `(y == 1) * (x == 1)` directly implies the first part of our loop invariant `((y == 1)&&(x == 1))`. Since the invariant is a disjunction where the first part is exactly the pre-condition, the pre-condition guarantees that the invariant is established before the loop begins execution.
