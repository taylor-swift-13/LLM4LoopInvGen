### Analysis

#### a. Purpose and Structure of the Loop
The loop's objective is to repeatedly update the values of `x` and `y` by adding their current values together. The loop condition `unknown()` means the loop can execute any number of times (including zero). The relevant variables are `x`, `y`, `t1`, and `t2`, where `t1` and `t2` are temporary variables used to store the values of `x` and `y` at the start of each iteration.

#### b. Discussion of the Loop Invariant
The proposed loop invariant must capture the relationship between `x` and `y` during the loop's execution. Since `x` and `y` are always updated to the same value (`t1 + t2`), they remain equal throughout the loop. The invariant should reflect that either:
1. `x` and `y` are both 1 (initial state, loop hasn't run), or
2. `x` and `y` are equal and at least 1 (after at least one iteration).

#### c. Establishment
Before the loop starts, `x == 1` and `y == 1` (given by the pre-condition). Thus, the first part of the invariant `((y == 1) && (x == 1))` is true, satisfying the establishment condition.

#### d. Preservation
If the loop runs at least once, `x` and `y` are updated to `t1 + t2` (which is `x + y`). Since `t1 == x` and `t2 == y` at the start of the iteration, and `x` and `y` are equal (from the invariant), the new values of `x` and `y` will be `x + x = 2x`, which preserves the equality and ensures they are at least 1.

#### e. Termination Analysis
When the loop terminates, the invariant must still hold. If the loop never runs, `x == 1` and `y == 1`. If it runs at least once, `x == y` and `x >= 1` (since `x` and `y` grow monotonically). The post-condition `y >= 1` is satisfied in both cases.

#### f. Correctness of the Post-condition
The post-condition `y >= 1` is implied by the invariant:
- If the loop never runs, `y == 1`.
- If the loop runs, `y == x` and `x >= 1` (since `x` starts at 1 and only increases).

#### g. Implication of the Pre-condition
The pre-condition `(y == 1) && (x == 1)` directly implies the first part of the invariant `((y == 1) && (x == 1))`, so the invariant is established before the loop starts.

### Filled-in Loop Invariants
The placeholders should be filled as follows:
- `PLACE_HOLDER_x`: `x == y`
- `PLACE_HOLDER_y`: `x >= 1`
