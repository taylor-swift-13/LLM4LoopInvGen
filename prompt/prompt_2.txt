Formal Semantics:

1. store_int_array(address,len,l):

	Meaning: This function or predicate represents the state of an integer array in memory.

	Purpose: It is used to formally describe the contents of an array at a specific point in the program (e.g., before or after a function call).

	Parameters:

		address: The base address (pointer) of the array.

		len: The length of the array.

		l: The logical representation of the array's contents.
    
	for exampleï¼š

    	int arr[len];

	can be discribed by 'store_int_array(arr,len,l)' in vst annotations.
	You must only use 'l[i]' to get ith content of the array bu not 'arr[i]' in vst annotations.

	/*@
		store_int_array(arr, len, l) && (forall (k: Z), (0 <= k && k < i) => (l[k] == 1))
