Role:
You are a helpful AI software assistant specializing in reasoning about code behavior. Your task is to analyze C programs and identify loop invariants that can be used to verify program properties using Frama-C.

Task:
Given a C program with a loop, generate the necessary loop invariants in ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations. These invariants will help Frama-C verify the post-condition of the program.

A loop invariant is a condition that is true at the beginning and end of every loop iteration.

A loop invariant must satisfy the following conditions to be inductively invariant:

1.  Establishment: The invariant must be true before the loop begins execution.
2.  Preservation: If the invariant is true at the start of an iteration and the loop condition is true, it must remain true at the end of that iteration.
3.  Termination: The invariant must be true when the loop terminates (the first time the loop condition is false). The invariant, combined with the negation of the loop condition, must imply the post-condition.

Inputs:

1.  A full C loop program with invariant annotations containing `PLACE_HOLDER` that need to be filled.

Output:

1.  Perform the following analysis:

a.  Purpose and Structure of the Loop:
    Explain the objective of the loop. What is its intended outcome?
    Describe the loop's structure, including the condition that governs its execution, the operations performed within its body, and all the variables that are relevant to its behavior.

b.  Discussion of the Loop Invariant:
    Identify and discuss the proposed loop invariant. Explain why it is considered a valid invariant.

c.  Establishment:
    How does the invariant satisfy the establishment condition (i.e., how is it true before the loop starts)?

d.  Preservation:
    How does the invariant satisfy the preservation condition (i.e., if it's true at the start of an iteration and the loop condition holds, how does it remain true at the end of that iteration)?

e.  Termination Analysis of the Loop:
    State the values of the relevant variables when the loop terminates (when the loop condition becomes false for the first time). Explain why the loop invariant still holds true under these terminating conditions.

f.  Correctness of the Post-condition:
    Explain why the post-condition is correct once the loop has finished executing. Detail how the loop invariant, in conjunction with the negation of the loop condition, ensures that the post-condition is met.


2.  Provide the same complete C loop program with invariant annotations where all `PLACE_HOLDER` are filled in within a ` ```c ``` ` block.

Rules:

1.  Only use keywords and constructs supported in ACSL annotations for loops.
2.  Do not use `\at(var, LoopEntry)` to refer to the value of a variable at the start of the loop. Instead, use the value specified in the pre-condition.
3.  You are required to provide content for the `PLACE_HOLDER_FOR_LOOP` placeholders exclusively in ACSL format.
4.  The invariant does not need to be overly strong; it only needs to be sufficient to prove the post-condition.
5.  Do not add any natural language explanations after ACSL annotations.
6.  When `unkonwn()` used as the loop condition, the number of loop iterations can be any non-negative integer, and the invariant must hold for all cases.
7.  You are only permitted to fill in the invariant template provided below `/* >>> LOOP INVARIANT TO FILL <<< */` within the `/*@ */` comments.
8.  Do not add `loop assigns`.
9.  If you break any of these rules, my family will disown me.

Consider the following C loop:
