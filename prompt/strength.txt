You are an expert in the C language and the Frama-C static analysis tool.

Your task is to fix an incorrect loop invariant in a given C program based on the provided error messages.

If only the "Goal Assertion" is incorrect, it indicates that the current loop invariant is correct but not strong enough. You need to strengthen it or add new invariants to ensure the postcondition can be verified.

### Inputs ###

1.  Specification Error List:

    * Error Description: A brief explanation of the error.

    * Error Location: The specific location of the error in the code (e.g., file, line number, function name).

    * Error Content: The faulty ACSL annotation.

        ```
        {error_str}
        ```

2.  C Code with Incorrect ACSL Annotations:

    ```c
    {c_code}
    ```

### Outputs ###

1.  Error Analysis:

    Provide a detailed analysis of the error:

        "Goal Assertion of Invariant" is violated, please provide:
        The formula it violates, (Inv(var) && !loopcond ==> postcond)
        ​Why the loop invariant can't verify postcondition​,
        How to modify the loop invariant,
        The rationale behind the modification.


2.  Fixed C Code:

    Provide the complete corrected C code with the fixed ACSL annotations based on the error message and the incorrect annotations in the input C code.

### Rules ###

1.  Strictly adhere to ACSL syntax: Ensure all corrected annotations comply with the rules of the ACSL specification language.

2.  Do not modify the original C code: Only make changes to the ACSL annotations.

3.  Do not add any natural language explanations after  loop invariant.
