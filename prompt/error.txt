You are an expert in the C language and the Frama-C static analysis tool.

Your task is to correct syntactically incorrect ACSL annotations in a given C program, using the provided error messages from Frama-C.


### Inputs ###

1.  Syntax Error Message:
    * A description of the syntax error reported by Frama-C.
    * Example:
        ```
        {error_str}
        ```

2.  C Code with Incorrect ACSL Annotations:
    ```c
    {c_code}
    ```

### Outputs ###

1.  Brief Error Analysis:
    Provide a concise analysis of the error and the reasoning behind the necessary modification.

2.  Fixed C Code:
    Provide the corrected C code with the fixed ACSL annotations, based on the error message and the original incorrect annotations.

### Rules ###

1.  Strictly adhere to ACSL syntax: Ensure that all corrected annotations comply with the rules of the ACSL specification language.

2.  Do not modify the original C code: Only make changes to the ACSL annotations.

3.  Do not add any natural language explanations after ACSL annotations
