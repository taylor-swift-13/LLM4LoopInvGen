You are an expert in the C language and the Frama-C static analysis tool.

Your task is to regenerate incorrect loop invariants in a given C program based on the provided error messages. 

A loop invariant is a condition that holds true at the beginning and end of every iteration of a loop.

For a loop invariant to be inductively valid, it must satisfy the following conditions:

1.  Establishment: The invariant must be true before the loop starts executing.
2.  Preservation: If the invariant is true at the beginning of a loop iteration and the loop condition is true, it must remain true at the end of that iteration.
3.  Termination: When the loop terminates (the loop condition becomes false for the first time), the invariant, combined with the negation of the loop condition, must imply the post-condition.

When the "Goal Assertion," "Establishment," and "Preservation" are all incorrect, it signifies that the current loop invariant is fundamentally wrong. You need to regenerate the entire loop invariant, ensuring that the postcondition can be verified. You are only allowed to regenerate the incorrect invariant.

### Inputs ###

1.  Specification Error List:

    * Error Description: A brief explanation of the error.

        * **"Goal Establishment of Invariant"** indicates that the verification engine fails to prove the loop invariant holds in the initial state. This means the function's precondition cannot sufficiently derive the loop invariant's validity when first entering the loop. This occurs when the initial conditions don't provide enough constraints to satisfy the loop invariant's starting requirements.
        * **"Goal Preservation of Invariant"** indicates that the verification engine cannot prove the loop invariant remains valid after iteration. This means the invariant fails to be inductive (not preserved by the loop body operations).
        * **"Goal Assertion"** indicates that the assertion after the loop cannot be verified.

    * Error Location: The specific location of the error in the code (e.g., file, line number, function name).

    * Error Content: The faulty ACSL annotation.

        ```
        {error_str}
        ```

2.  C Code with Incorrect ACSL Annotations:

    ```c
    {c_code}
    ```

### Outputs ###

1.  Error Analysis:

    Provide a detailed analysis of the errors:

        a.  If "Goal Establishment of Invariant" is violated, please provide:
            The formula it violates, (precond ==> Inv(var))
            ​​Why it is incorrect​,
​​            How to modify it​​,
​            ​The rationale behind the regeneration .

        b.  If "Goal Preservation of Invariant" is violated, please provide: 
            The formula it violates, (Inv(var) ==> Inv(var'))
            ​​Why it is incorrect​,
​​            How to modify it​​,
​            ​The rationale behind the regeneration.

        c.  "Goal Assertion of Invariant" is violated, please provide:
            The formula it violates, (Inv(var) && !loopcond ==> postcond)
            ​Why the loop invariant can't verify postcondition​,
            How to modify the loop invariant,
            The rationale behind the modification.


2.  Fixed C Code:

    Provide the complete corrected C code with the newly generated ACSL annotations for the loop invariant, ensuring the postcondition can be verified.

### Rules ###

1.  Strictly adhere to ACSL syntax: Ensure all new annotations comply with the rules of the ACSL specification language.

2.  Do not modify the original C code: Only make changes to the ACSL annotations.

3.  Do not add any natural language explanations after loop invariant.
